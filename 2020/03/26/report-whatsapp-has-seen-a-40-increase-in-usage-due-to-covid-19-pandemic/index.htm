				<p id="speakable-summary">Social media usage has grown as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, as more users go online to stay connected with family, friends and colleagues. Now, new data from insights and consulting firm <a href="https://www.kantar.com/Inspiration/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Barometer-Consumer-attitudes-media-habits-and-expectations">Kantar</a> reveals exactly how much some apps are benefiting. According to a survey of more than 25,000 consumers in 30 markets conducted from March 14 to 24, WhatsApp is the social media app that has experienced the greatest gains due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Overall, Facebook-owned WhatsApp has seen a 40% increase in usage that grew from an initial 27% bump in the earlier days of the pandemic to 41% in the mid-phase. For countries already in the later phase of the pandemic, WhatsApp usage has jumped by 51%.</p>
<p>In individual markets, that usage may be even higher, Kantar noted. For example, WhatsApp usage in Spain was up 76%.</p>
<p>Across all messaging platforms, the growth in usage has been the largest in the 18 to 34-year-old age group, the study also found. In addition, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram saw a 40%+ increase in usage from this same demographic.</p>
<p>Other social media apps seeing gains during the pandemic include, not surprisingly, Facebook and China&#8217;s WeChat and Weibo.</p>
<p>Overall, Facebook usage has increased by 37%, while China&#8217;s local social media apps saw usage climb by 58%, Kantar says.</p>
<p>Despite the gains, consumers reported they didn&#8217;t trust their social media platforms for critical news related to COVID-19. National news channels and government agency websites were considered better options, with 58% and 48% of survey respondents, respectively, identifying them as a &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; source of news and information. Social media platforms, meanwhile, were only considered &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; by 11% of consumers.</p>
<p>Kantar&#8217;s is not the first study to report on the growth in social media activity attributed to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/03/keeping-our-apps-stable-during-covid-19/">Facebook recently shared its own data</a>, noting that total messaging on its platform was up by more than 50% over last month. This would include Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp combined. It also claimed that time across all apps since the crisis had grown 70%, as well, and time in group calls (three or more participants) was up by more than 1,000% during the last month.</p>
<p>In addition, Instagram and Facebook Live views doubled in a week&#8217;s time, Facebook said.</p>
<p>While not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, Facebook&#8217;s metrics confirm Kantar&#8217;s report of significant growth during March related to the pandemic. The company spoke, too, of preparing its infrastructure for this unprecedented amount of usage. Previously, Facebook was able to remain stable during major events, like New Year&#8217;s Eve or the Olympics, but now says it&#8217;s seeing sustained, record levels of use, which required it to reduce bit rates on Facebook and Instagram videos and add capacity as needed.</p>
<p>Related to this, another report from influencer marketing platform <a href="https://klear.com/">Klear</a> compared the week of March 7-14 to the week of March 15-21, in order to drill down into more specific Instagram user behavior. It found that users posted 6.1 Instagram Stories per day, on average, an increase of 15% week-over-week. Stories&#8217; impressions, meaning views, also increased by 21% during that time.</p>

According to him, the SEC is threatening to sue the cryptocurrency exchange if it launches its yield-generating product called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/lend\">Coinbase Lend<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With this new product, Coinbase wants to compete with popular decentralized finance (DeFi) products, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/compound.finance\">Compound<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/aave.com\">Aave<\/a>. The company wants to operate a lending pool focused on USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin that is pegged to USD.<\/p>\n<p>If the company manages to launch Coinbase Lend, users will be able to contribute to the lending pool by sending crypto assets to Coinbase Lend. Eventually, the company plans to lend out those crypto assets. Coinbase users get high interest rates in exchange to contributing to the lending pool. Coinbase promises 4% APY on its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/lend\">preview page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>According to Brian Armstrong, the company reached out to the SEC before releasing it. \u201cThey responded by telling us this lend feature is a security,\u201d he said <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brian_armstrong\/status\/1435439543692365828\">on Twitter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey refuse to tell us why they think it&#8217;s a security, and instead subpoena a bunch of records from us (we comply), demand testimony from our employees (we comply), and then tell us they will be suing us if we proceed to launch, with zero explanation as to why,\u201d he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brian_armstrong\/status\/1435439621190471683\">added<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal also wrote about the events on the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009\">company\u2019s blog<\/a>. It appears that the company decided to move forward and pre-announce the new feature despite the SEC saying that Coinbase\u2019s Lend program is a security.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe SEC told us they consider Lend to involve a security, but wouldn\u2019t say why or how they\u2019d reached that conclusion. Rather than get discouraged, we chose to continue taking things slowly. In June, we announced our Lend program publicly and opened a waitlist but did not set a public launch date,\u201d Grewal <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009\">wrote<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a pro tip for entrepreneurs reading this post: If the SEC tells you that you can\u2019t launch something, don\u2019t put up a waitlist with the words &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>To no one\u2019s surprise, Coinbase says that the SEC decided to open a formal investigation after that. <em>One<\/em> employee also had to spend a day with the SEC to answer questions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey asked for documents and written responses, and we willingly provided them. They also asked for us to provide a corporate witness to give sworn testimony about the program. As a result, one of our employees spent a full day in August providing complete and transparent testimony about Lend,\u201d Grewal wrote.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Coinbase is now mad and has chosen to launch a PR campaign against the SEC. Brian Armstrong\u2019s main argument is that other companies have been offering lending pools already, so there\u2019s no reason why some companies can offer such a product and not Coinbase.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMeanwhile, plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer a lend feature, but Coinbase is somehow not allowed to,\u201d he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brian_armstrong\/status\/1435440007787921413\">tweeted<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is a risky strategy as Coinbase could end up alienating the crypto ecosystem at large. There could be increased scrutiny on DeFi and industrywide enforcement of stricter rules, as Sar Haribhakti <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sarthakgh\/status\/1435629740392652802\">pointed out<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOstensibly the SEC&#8217;s goal is to protect investors and create fair markets. So who are they protecting here and where is the harm? People seem pretty happy to be earning yield on these various products, across lots of other crypto companies,\u201d Brian Armstrong <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brian_armstrong\/status\/1435440225560371200\">said<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you read the fine print, Coinbase doesn\u2019t protect investors with its Lend program. Here\u2019s what it says <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/lend\">at the bottom of the Coinbase Lend page<\/a>: \u201cLend is not a high-yield USD savings account, and Coinbase is not a bank. Your loaned crypto is not protected by FDIC or SIPC insurance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not very reassuring for investors. At some point, Coinbase and the SEC will have to sit at the same table to discuss crypto lending products because a tweetstorm won&#8217;t solve the issue.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reacted strongly to the company\u2019s current relationship with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/4733\/startups-worldwide\/\">startups and unicorns<\/a> each year than any other country in the world, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.failory.com\/blog\/startup-failure-rate\">90% of startups fail<\/a>, with cash flow often being a major challenge.<\/p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs trying to raise funding for their new businesses are faced with a maze of options, with most taking the common route of equity rounds. There\u2019s clearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abladvisor.com\/news\/30176\/vc-investment-in-u-s-hits-new-record-high-in-2020-kpmg\">a lot of venture money<\/a> to be raised \u2014 and most tech entrepreneurs happily take it in exchange for equity. This works for some, but too often founders find themselves diluting their equity to unrecoverable portions rather than considering other financing options that allow them to hold on to their company \u2014 options like debt capital.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tEven if you\u2019re growing quickly, not all founders want to set a valuation for their company. In that case, you can offer investors &#8220;convertible debt.&#8221;\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Despite the VC flurries of 2020 creating an ecosystem of seemingly endless equity, it\u2019s important for entrepreneurs and founders to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all model for raising capital. Debt capital, which refers to capital raised by taking out a loan, is an alternative route that entrepreneurs should consider.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding the real cost of venture debt and when it makes more sense than the traditional equity route relies on an understanding of what you and your company hope to achieve.<\/p>\n<h2>Understanding your goals<\/h2>\n<p>We mainly see two kinds of startups today: Those that want to try something new, and the ones that focus on making things faster, cheaper or simpler. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are good examples of the first kind \u2014 social media didn\u2019t exist before the internet. Discount airlines, cell phones (not smartphones) and integrated circuits are good examples of the \u201cfaster, cheaper, simpler\u201d variety, because they simply displaced familiar incumbents.<\/p>\n<p>Many entrepreneurs are eager to be the next \u201ctry something new\u201d success story, and I applaud them for feeling that way. Carving out your own market is a fast-track to entrepreneurial stardom if you\u2019re successful. But unless your main goal is to be famous, it\u2019s often impractical and distracting.<\/p>\n<p>People tend to think that category creation is less risky than incumbent disruption. However, as long as you\u2019re truly faster, cheaper and simpler, patience and strategy can propel you to where you want to be.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Just as there are different market approaches, there are a number of funding strategies that work best for your goals.

Our business went from doing $250 million+ to negligible scale in a matter of weeks.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"SelFNwUHX9\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/travel-activities-platform-kkday-raises-75-million-series-c-as-it-focuses-on-staycations\/\">Travel activities platform KKday raises $75 million Series C as it focuses on &#8216;staycations&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Travel activities platform KKday raises $75 million Series C as it focuses on &#8216;staycations&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/29\/travel-activities-platform-kkday-raises-75-million-series-c-as-it-focuses-on-staycations\/embed\/#?secret=SelFNwUHX9\" data-secret=\"SelFNwUHX9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p class=\"p3\">But as travel gradually resumes, Headout identified \u201ctwo massive tailwinds.\u201d The first is an unprecedented demand for domestic travel. The second are travel experience providers who are digitizing for the first time. The company began focusing on domestic tourism in the last quarter of 2020. It\u2019s seeing the highest demand in places with relatively high vaccination rates, like the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Arab Emirates.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cTo win this space, we prioritized onboarding new experiences that are more diverse, local and niche to attract domestic travelers. We standardized these mom-and-pop experience providers, upgraded their services and brought them online,\u201d said Khona. \u201cIn conjunction, we worked hard on making Headout available in local languages \u2014 not just with machine translation but by actually ensuring we create content that is compelling and inspiring.\u201d For example, 85% of bookings in Spain are sold in Spanish.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p3\">When asked how Headout differentiates from other on-demand booking marketplaces, Khona said in 2018 it evolved from a traditional listings oriented marketplace, like <a href=\"http:\/\/Booking.com\"><span class=\"s1\">Booking.com<\/span><\/a>, to a \u201cmore managed marketplace\u201d by standardizing, upgrading and branding experiences to ensure consistent quality. This increased conversion rates, which in turn \u201chelped us provide more sales to our partners and hence command a higher take rate,\u201d leading to profitable unit economics.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0fXR1Auuh5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/29\/travelperk-raises-160m-in-equity-and-debt-after-a-year-of-derailed-business-trips\/\">TravelPerk raises $160M in equity and debt after a year of derailed business trips<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;TravelPerk raises $160M in equity and debt after a year of derailed business trips&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/29\/travelperk-raises-160m-in-equity-and-debt-after-a-year-of-derailed-business-trips\/embed\/#?secret=0fXR1Auuh5\" data-secret=\"0fXR1Auuh5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"BRoClpvxuk\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/17\/hopper-raises-170m-on-3-5b-valuation-as-travel-surges-and-its-fintech-tools-help-offset-variant-concerns\/\">Hopper raises $175M at $3.5B+ valuation as travel surges and its fintech tools help offset variant concerns<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Hopper raises $175M at $3.5B+ valuation as travel surges and its fintech tools help offset variant concerns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/17\/hopper-raises-170m-on-3-5b-valuation-as-travel-surges-and-its-fintech-tools-help-offset-variant-concerns\/embed\/#?secret=BRoClpvxuk\" data-secret=\"BRoClpvxuk\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The\u00a0travel industry was one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, and startup Headout was no exception.

acquires video creation and editing software maker Clipchamp"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Video editing software may become the next big addition to Microsoft&#8217;s suite of productivity tools. On Tuesday, Microsoft <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/microsoft-365\/blog\/2021\/09\/07\/microsoft-acquires-clipchamp-to-empower-creators\/\">announced<\/a> it&#8217;s acquiring <a href=\"https:\/\/clipchamp.com\/en\/\">Clipchamp<\/a>, a company offering web-based video creation and editing software that allows anyone to put together video presentations, promos or videos meant for social media destinations like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. According to Microsoft, Clipchamp is a &#8220;natural fit&#8221; to extend its existing productivity experiences in Microsoft 365 for families, schools and businesses.<\/p>\n<p>The acquisition appealed to Microsoft for a few reasons. Today, more people are creating and using video, thanks to a growing set of new tools that allow anyone &#8212; even non-professionals &#8212; to quickly and easily perform advanced edits and produce quality video content. This, explains Microsoft, has allowed video to establish itself as a new type of &#8220;document&#8221; for businesses to do things like pitch an idea, explain a process or communicate with team members.<\/p>\n<p>The company also saw Clipchamp as an interesting acquisition target due to how it combined &#8220;the simplicity of a web app with the full computing power of a PC with graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,&#8221; it said. That makes the software a good fit for the Microsoft Windows customer base, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Clipchamp itself had built a number of online tools in the video creation and editing space, including its video maker Clipchamp Create, which offers features for trimming, cutting, cropping, rotating and speed control, and adding text, audio, images, colors and filters. It also provides other tools that make video creation easier, like templates, free stock video and audio libraries, screen recorders, text-to-speech tools and others for simplifying a brand&#8217;s fonts, colors and logos for use in video. A discontinued set of utilities called Clipchamp Utilities had once included a video compressor and converters, as well as an in-browser webcam recorder. Some of this functionality was migrated over to the new Clipchamp app, however.<\/p>\n<p>After producing the videos with Clipchamp, creators can choose between different output styles and aspect ratios for popular social media networks, making it a popular tool for online marketers.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2199381\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2199381\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2199381\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/clipchamp.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/clipchamp.jpg 3298w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/clipchamp.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/clipchamp.jpg?resize=300,127 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/clipchamp.jpg?resize=768,325 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/clipchamp.jpg?resize=680,288 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/clipchamp.jpg?resize=1536,650 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/clipchamp.jpg?resize=2048,867 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/clipchamp.jpg?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2199381\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Clipchamp<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Since its founding in 2013, Clipchamp grew to attract more than 17 million registered users and has served over 390,000 companies, growing at a rate of 54% year-over-year. As the pandemic forced more organizations toward remote work, the use of video has grown as companies adopted the medium for training, communication, reports and more. During the first half of 2021, Clipchamp <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/clipchamp_achieves_17_million_registered_users_announces_massive_54_year_over_year_company_growth\/prweb18067370.htm\">saw a 186% increase in video exports<\/a>. Videos using the 16:9 aspect ratio grew by 189%, while the 9:16 aspect ratio for sharing to places like Instagram Stories and TikTok grew by 140% and the 1:1 aspect ratio for Instagram grew 72%. Screen recording also grew 57% and webcam recording grew 65%.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In July, Clipchamp CEO Alexander Dreiling commented on this growth, noting the company had nearly tripled its team over the past year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are acquiring two times more users on average than we did at the same time a year ago while also doubling the usage rate, meaning more users are creating video content than ever before. While social media videos have always been at the forefront of business needs, during the past year we\u2019ve also witnessed the rapid adoption of internal communication use cases where there is a lot of screen and webcam recording taking place in our platform,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft didn&#8217;t disclose the acquisition price, but Clipchamp had raised over $15 million in funding, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/clipchamp-pty-ltd\">Crunchbase<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is not Microsoft&#8217;s first attempt at entering the video market.<\/p>\n<p>The company was recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/02\/microsoft-pursuing-tiktok-purchase-with-september-15th-deadline-may-invite-u-s-investors-to-participate\/\">one of the suitors pursuing TikTok<\/a> when the Trump administration was working to force a sale of the China-owned video social network, which Trump had dubbed a national security threat. (In order to keep TikTok running in the U.S., ByteDance would have needed to have divested TikTok&#8217;s U.S. operations. But that sale never came to be as the Biden administration paused the effort.) Several years ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/07\/18\/microsoft-stream-is-a-new-video-service-for-businesses\/\">Microsoft also launched a business video service called Stream<\/a>, which aimed to allow enterprises to use video as easily as consumers use YouTube. In 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/18\/microsoft-acquires-social-learning-platform-flipgrid\/\">it acquired social learning platform Flipgrid,<\/a> which used short video clips for collaboration. And as remote work became the norm, Microsoft has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/08\/microsoft-makes-teams-video-meetings-less-tiring-with-its-new-together-mode\/\">adding more video capabilities<\/a> to its team collaboration software, Microsoft Teams, too.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft&#8217;s deal follows <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/19\/adobe-buying-frame-io-in-1-28b-deal\/\">Adobe&#8217;s recent $1.28 acquisition<\/a> of the video review and collaboration platform Frame.io, which has been used by over a million people since its founding in 2014. However, unlike Clipchamp, whose tools are meant for anyone to use at work, school or home, Frame.io is aimed more directly at creative professionals.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"rDfCl3Y8an\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/19\/adobe-buying-frame-io-in-1-28b-deal\/\">Adobe buying Frame.io in $1.28B deal<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Adobe buying Frame.io in $1.28B deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/19\/adobe-buying-frame-io-in-1-28b-deal\/embed\/#?secret=rDfCl3Y8an\" data-secret=\"rDfCl3Y8an\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Dreiling said Clipchamp will continue to grow at Microsoft, with a focus on making video editing accessible to more people.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Few companies in tech have the legacy and reach that Microsoft has. We all grew up with iconic Microsoft products and have been using them ever since,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Becoming part of Microsoft allows us to become part of a future legacy. Under no other scenario could our future look more exciting than what\u2019s ahead of us now. At Clipchamp we have always said that we\u2019re not suffering from a lack of opportunity, there absolutely is an abundance of opportunity in video. We just need to figure out how to seize it. Inside Microsoft we can approach seizing our opportunity in entirely new ways,&#8221; Dreiling added.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft did not say when it expected to integrate Clipchamp into its existing software suite, saying it would share more at a later date.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Video editing software may become the next big addition to Microsoft&#8217;s suite of productivity tools.

WhatsApp has seen a 40% increase in usage due to COVID-19 pandemic"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Social media usage has grown as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, as more users go online to stay connected with family, friends and colleagues. Now, new data from insights and consulting firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kantar.com\/Inspiration\/Coronavirus\/COVID-19-Barometer-Consumer-attitudes-media-habits-and-expectations\">Kantar<\/a> reveals exactly how much some apps are benefiting. According to a survey of more than 25,000 consumers in 30 markets conducted from March 14 to 24, WhatsApp is the social media app that has experienced the greatest gains due to COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Facebook-owned WhatsApp has seen a 40% increase in usage that grew from an initial 27% bump in the earlier days of the pandemic to 41% in the mid-phase. For countries already in the later phase of the pandemic, WhatsApp usage has jumped by 51%.<\/p>\n<p>In individual markets, that usage may be even higher, Kantar noted. For example, WhatsApp usage in Spain was up 76%.<\/p>\n<p>Across all messaging platforms, the growth in usage has been the largest in the 18 to 34-year-old age group, the study also found. In addition, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram saw a 40%+ increase in usage from this same demographic.<\/p>\n<p>Other social media apps seeing gains during the pandemic include, not surprisingly, Facebook and China&#8217;s WeChat and Weibo.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Facebook usage has increased by 37%, while China&#8217;s local social media apps saw usage climb by 58%, Kantar says.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the gains, consumers reported they didn&#8217;t trust their social media platforms for critical news related to COVID-19. National news channels and government agency websites were considered better options, with 58% and 48% of survey respondents, respectively, identifying them as a &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; source of news and information. Social media platforms, meanwhile, were only considered &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; by 11% of consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Kantar&#8217;s is not the first study to report on the growth in social media activity attributed to the COVID-19 outbreak.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/03\/keeping-our-apps-stable-during-covid-19\/\">Facebook recently shared its own data<\/a>, noting that total messaging on its platform was up by more than 50% over last month. This would include Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp combined. It also claimed that time across all apps since the crisis had grown 70%, as well, and time in group calls (three or more participants) was up by more than 1,000% during the last month.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Instagram and Facebook Live views doubled in a week&#8217;s time, Facebook said.<\/p>\n<p>While not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, Facebook&#8217;s metrics confirm Kantar&#8217;s report of significant growth during March related to the pandemic. The company spoke, too, of preparing its infrastructure for this unprecedented amount of usage. Previously, Facebook was able to remain stable during major events, like New Year&#8217;s Eve or the Olympics, but now says it&#8217;s seeing sustained, record levels of use, which required it to reduce bit rates on Facebook and Instagram videos and add capacity as needed.<\/p>\n<p>Related to this, another report from influencer marketing platform <a href=\"https:\/\/klear.com\/\">Klear<\/a> compared the week of March 7-14 to the week of March 15-21, in order to drill down into more specific Instagram user behavior. It found that users posted 6.1 Instagram Stories per day, on average, an increase of 15% week-over-week. Stories&#8217; impressions, meaning views, also increased by 21% during that time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/pages\/covid-19-updates\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/covid-19-footer.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Social media usage has grown as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, as more users go online to stay connected with family, friends and colleagues.
