<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174090"></a><b>1. </b><strong><b>Set Social Goals For Your Small Business</b></strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3165" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social-sharing-people.png" alt="graphic of people sharing and consuming social content." width="1378" height="786" /></p>
<p>Here’s a question: can you spell out the impact your social marketing strategy a) has had, and b) aims to have? If you can’t answer in a heartbeat, we have a problem.</p>
<p>What we’re trying to say is, you need to have social media goals for your small business. And every interaction and success you have needs to be measured against these goals.</p>
<p>Walk yourself through the buyer’s journey for your product or service, and at each step, identify what your target is, what kind of social activity you’ll use to achieve that target, what the KPIs are for that activity, and the impact you want it to have. This sets up a nifty feedback loop that allows you to tweak your content to your heart’s content.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of social media goals to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase web traffic</li>
<li>Increase how many people engage with your posts</li>
<li>Make people aware of your brand</li>
<li>Distribute informative content regarding a product/service</li>
<li>Get more sign ups</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174091"></a><b>2. </b><strong><b>Define and Own Your Brand’s Voice</b></strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3166" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nordstrom-campaign-facebook.png" alt="Nordstrom’s campaign to do better with sustainable fashion" width="374" height="616" /></p>
<p>Let’s dwell on this campaign from social media titan and clothing behemoth Nordstrom for a bit. Notice how they effortlessly weave in a service they’re offering into a campaign that’s also supposed to help save the planet. Associations like these stay in consumers’ minds, and are very powerful sales tools.</p>
<p>Alongside, the verdict is in—people don’t want to interact with businesses that sound like there’s no one behind them. They want a magical Oz-like character behind the curtains, orchestrating the company; someone who’s a real big personality. They also want this person to be the face of the company, so they’re talking to someone they can trust.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for your small business’s social media marketing plan? For starters, if you’re the owner and fashion yourself to have even a little bit of charisma, try to put yourself front and center in all the video content you put out. Better yet, get the whole team on board by asking employees if being the public face of the company is something they’re interested in.</p>
<p>You could also go the behind-the-scenes route with your social media presence—this really humanizes your company.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174092"></a><b>3. </b><strong><b>Who’s Your Social Audience?</b></strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3167" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social-marketing-right-person.png" alt="graphic of the right person being targeted with a social media strategy" width="1174" height="726" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s marketing 101, but we’ll scream it from the rooftops anyway: <strong><b>you need to know your audience</b></strong>! And when we say know them, we mean really know them.</p>
<p>So, while you may have a general sense of the fact that 20 somethings who identify as women like your beauty products, you also need to know where they are, how engaged they are, and whether there’s additional consumers out there who augment your core audience. Your social media digital marketing strategy needs to account for all possible variables.</p>
<p>The answer, as always, lies in data. And the good news is that social media platforms give you bucketloads of it. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook already come with robust demographics analysis tools, but it doesn’t even stop there; you can complement these tools with some seriously heavy-hitting third party plugins.</p>
<p>All of this comes together to give you a pretty complete picture of who your audience is comprised of, allowing you to take decisions accordingly. Once you have your core demographic, all you have to do is research the kind of content they’re into, and you’re good to go!</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174093"></a><b>4. </b><strong><b>Looking At Competitors’ Past Content—The Proof is in the Pudding</b></strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3168" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GoPro-campaign.png" alt="GoPro’s featured images" width="379" height="593" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GoPro is the undisputed king of daily featured photos content; and it didn’t have to reinvent the wheel. All it did was take customers using their product in daring situations, and it put a new spin on an old format.</p>
<p>It’s not cheating if you make the content your own! Here’s the thing, there’s no such thing as completely novel content—it’s always a mishmash of what’s been done before, made new with your unique twist on it.</p>
<p>So when we say that the map to your success already exists, we mean it. All you need to do is look at what established competitors have been doing for a really long time—what worked, what didn’t, and what you can take and improve upon.</p>
<p>Remember, industries need to keep up with trends, and you want to be ahead of the curve too, not always catching up. That means you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take competitors’ content and find a way to make it fresh</li>
<li>Alongside, you need to innovate, so customers see you as the popular new kid around the block</li>
<li>You can also mix and match competitors’ content to create new formats altogether</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174094"></a><b>5. </b><strong><b>Serve Up Some Value Additive Content</b></strong></h2>
<p>Nothing gets your followers to leave en masse like you wasting their time. Here are some social actions that could make your brand a pariah on social media:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spamming your followers with promotional messages</li>
<li>Posting way too much</li>
<li>Not posting at all</li>
<li>Coming up with posts that don’t solve any problems that your audience has</li>
</ul>
<p>The takeaway? That every post you make needs to be worth your audience’s time. We’re not saying you need to be somber and informative either—casual tones work great, but the post still needs to tell potential customers something they want to hear.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a social media post from social media staple Starbucks:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3169" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starbucks-post.png" alt="Starbucks’ social media marketing strategy that involved product features" width="397" height="497" /></p>
<p>Notice how the post is beyond chill (pun intended), but it tells you a lot about the product. The featured image is super flattering and you know it’s a mix of salty and sweet that’ll help you beat the heat—it’s a winning combination, and just in a few words (Notice the effective use of the hashtag here too).</p>
<p>Once you strike the balance between the right tone and the right amount of information, every post will be a winner.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174095"></a><b>6. </b><strong><b>Be a Content Chameleon</b></strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3170" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mac-cosmetics-instagram.png" alt="Mac Cosmetics’ social media business plan involving many different content strategies" width="650" height="635" /></p>
<p>In the age of digital media consumption, the worst thing you could be is unchanging. The type of content you serve to clients needs to be as varied as possible, taking full advantage of all the media and other features different social platforms give you.</p>
<p>See the image above from Mac Cosmetics’ Instagram page? Notice how at the same time, they have new social media posts, Highlights, and Stories for consumers to peruse. It’s an all-of-the-above approach that really seems to show that the brand is doing well.</p>
<p>Do you only post GIFs on your Buzzfeed-esque pop culture page? How about changing it up by posting compilation videos as well? Have an Instagram feed that your customers already love? Spice up engagement levels by leveraging Stories, IGTV, and Highlights. You get the picture.</p>
<p>Here’s the kicker, even conventional wisdom flies out the door if you’re only posting the same type of content. You know how people say that posts with images do better than just plain text? Well, it turns out, if you keep on posting images, eventually, they get stale, and people want out of your page.</p>
<p>The key is to keep on reinventing yourself for your audience, and to keep them guessing.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174096"></a><b>7. </b><strong><b>Engage, Engage, Engage</b></strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3171" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starbucks-twitter.png" alt="Starbucks’ Twitter marketing plan involves replying to customers’ queries." width="527" height="238" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starbucks didn’t have to reply to this customer’s question about using personal cups during the pandemic; but it did, because it’s super relevant to a lot of people these days, and makes the brand seem like it cares.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, customers just want to feel like you have their back. There’s nothing more frustrating than getting a product or signing up for a service, only to face a glaring problem with it. Actually, wait, there is—it’s experiencing radio silence when you reach out to the company for help.</p>
<p>Most brands are under the false belief that customers should come to them—but here’s a reality check, when you’re running a small business that still doesn’t have a ton of traction, you’re going to have to bite first.</p>
<p>The good news is, it’s not hard; in fact, we’ve broken it down into a neat list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kill two birds with one stone by sharing content from someone in your core audience, and tag them for a mutually beneficial relationship (They’re also very likely to give you a shoutout for this!)</li>
<li>When customers comment on your posts, reply to as many comments as you can, especially the ones asking for specific information. There’s nothing like making people feel heard.</li>
<li>Another pro tip is to follow people who are following your competitor, as they’re sure to take notice when a brand takes the time out to give them a follow</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174097"></a><b>8. </b><strong><b>It’s All in the Metrics—Review Social Analytics</b></strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3177 size-full" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social-media-metrics.png" alt="different metrics related to different social platforms." width="886" height="626" /></p>
<p>Social media platforms thrive on data; it’s their great money-maker, after all. But data untapped serves no purposes, which is why platforms like Facebook and Instagram give you unprecedented insight into who your followers are, how much engagement they exhibit, and how they find your content.</p>
<p>But metrics can be deceptive; for instance, being bent on the number of likes and followers means nothing if your page isn’t getting the kind of targeted engagement that leads to someone taking a desired business action.</p>
<p>Wait, what does any of that mean? To simplify, if you’re running an up and coming residential repairs business and get a ton of likes on your blog posts, but not one of those leads actually calls you to step in, it’s a major problem.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s super important to identify what metrics are important to you, and then proceed to double down on them.</p>
<p>So, buckle up, because we’re taking a deep dive.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc70174098"></a>a. Impressions</h3>
<p>Impressions is just a metric that tells you how many times a post showed up on people’s social timelines. So while you naturally want impressions to be high, if no one is interacting with your post as they see it, that’s really bad news.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc70174099"></a>b. Engagement</h3>
<p>Engagement is the second piece of the puzzle; your impression to engagement ratio needs to be as close to 1 as possible. This is because engagement tells you how many people actually <em><i>interacted </i></em>with your post. This includes likes, shares, and comments, among a host of other actions, based on the platform.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc70174100"></a>c. Visits</h3>
<p>Visits tells you how many people went from a post to your main profile. It’s a surprisingly important metric because it tells you how much interest your post drummed up for the larger brand.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc70174101"></a>d. Mentions</h3>
<p>Mentions refers to when your brand gets a shoutout, or when someone else refers to your brand—either in passing or in the form of a review or a query. It’s a good indication of whether you’re part of the larger industry conversation.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc70174102"></a>e. Followers</h3>
<p>This one’s pretty simple; it’s the number of people who are following you on your social media page, and indicates how fast your popularity is rising. It’s also a great metric for comparisons against direct competitors.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174103"></a><b>9. </b><strong><b>Get Platform Specific in Your Approach</b></strong></h2>
<p>We’re not going to beat around the bush; here’s what you need to do to be successful on some core social media platforms:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/infographic-social-advertising.jpg" alt="Infographic on how to advertise on different social media platforms" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3183" /></p>
<h2><b>10. </b><strong><b>Use Social Media As A New Frontier For Customer Service</b></strong></h2>
<p>We’ve come a long way from the days of snail mail being used to bring up customer complaints. Follow up times were atrocious, and this meant that a lot of people just never reached out</p>
<p>The opposite is true these days. Customers expect near instant replies, and that includes having a responsive Facebook Messenger and Twitter presence.</p>
<p>The best part is that both of these platforms have different levels of automation features in place, so customers don’t have to wait around for the simplest queries to be answered.</p>
<p>But to really get them on board, try to personalize the online customer service experience as much as possible. Hire a team to reply to customers with questions and complaints, and make sure you steer clear of stock answers as you talk to them.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174117"></a><b>11. </b><strong><b>Look For Trends </b></strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Old Spice ALS Ice Bucket Challenge" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WfO8LR_VosI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the #ALSIceBucketChallenge to dabbing, and even the dark places the internet went to with the Tide pod challenge, online pop culture never stays put.</p>
<p>The key here is to take these trends and adopt them in a way that makes sense for your brand. For example, if it’s men’s health week or breast cancer awareness day, it makes sense to highlight employees who have dealt with these issues, and <em><i>then </i></em>talk about how your brand is trying to make a difference.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, if there’s a beauty YouTube trend going around, make your own video using your in-house products if your brand sells cosmetics. Remember, your audience is really honed into content that’s not true to your brand, and any missteps can lead to mistrust.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174118"></a><b>12. </b><strong><b>Find the Best #hashtags</b></strong></h2>
<p>Hashtags are more versatile than you’re giving them credit for! They’re equal parts research opportunity and discoverability tool, making them really important in your social media arsenal.</p>
<p>There really are so many ways to use them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hop aboard trends and ask people to tag your brand in the official hashtag if it’s related to your core business.</li>
<li>Host contests and ask all your followers to use the same hashtags, generating a ton of buzz around the event.</li>
<li>Figure out what hashtags are doing super well for your competitors, and start using them to divert traffic to your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just the tip of the iceberg! There are all kinds of tools out there that allow you to find the top ranking hashtag in a certain niche, as well as how hard it is to rank for them. So don’t hesitate, and jump on board the #bandwagon.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174119"></a><b>13. </b><strong><b>Double Down on Social Media Optimizations</b></strong></h2>
<p>While this can get a little technical—and is often best left to the social media marketing experts—it’s important to know that even social media content can’t escape our SEO overlords.</p>
<p>But wait, what’s so hard about throwing in a couple of hashtags, right? Well, here are a few questions in rebuttal:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many hashtags for each platform before they’re counted as spam?</li>
<li>What size should the ideal Facebook featured image be?</li>
<li>How do you maximize your returns from your YouTube titles and descriptions?</li>
</ul>
<p>What we’re trying to say is, there’s a ton of platforms out there, and that means the number of variables when it comes to social media optimizations really is staggering.</p>
<p>But if you’re still going solo, here are a few time-honored social media tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only use hashtags that are industry specific and medium to high volume.</li>
<li>Stick to three hashtags for Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, as many as twenty on Instagram.</li>
<li>Where there’s video content, make sure there’s also meta data to make it readable for search engines.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc70174120"></a><b>14. </b><strong><b>Get Social Media Experts on Board</b></strong></h2>
<p>To build upon the previous point, it really is in your best interests to hire social media marketing experts in the long-term. They can help you develop a long-term strategy that takes an omnichannel approach, while also optimizing for each platform keeping best practices in mind.</p>
<p>It’s a win-win scenario, because freeing up resources that would be otherwise spent on social media management will open you up to generating revenues using core business activities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting Backlinks With Infographics and Guestographics</p>
<p>Let’s start with a hard-hitting fact: just the ‘infographic’ hashtag has <a href="https://app.brandmentions.com/h/p/75805/infographic"><u>a weekly reach of over 64,400 people</u></a>! And whether it’s B2B marketers or people looking for easy instructions for a life hack, infographics are becoming more popular than ever.</p>
<p>Whether it’s infographics that are hosted on your website or value additive guestographics that you customize for high DA platforms, they bring the backlinks rolling in.</p>
<p>Are Infographics Good for SEO?</p>
<p>At this point, it probably won’t shock you when we say that infographics—specifically guestographics—are still far and above one of the best ways to generate high-quality backlinks. They’re easily shareable, actually give people content they care about, and are visually appealing—a content marketing trifecta.</p>
<p>All of this leads to more traffic on your website, and proof for search engines that your domain gives a ton of value to visitors.</p>
<p>Having said this, let’s talk about how your SEO strategy needs to use infographics, so you can generate a ton of backlink juice:</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc68802091"></a></h1>
<h1><a name="_Toc71808549"></a>The Perfect Infographics SEO Strategy: An Essential Guide For Every Business</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808550"></a><b>1. </b><strong><b>Pack Them With Content Value</b></strong></h2>
<p>We know we sound like a broken record, but value really is at the heart of creating infographics that people actually care about. Your infographic needs to be bursting at the seams with credible data that’s organized in a really helpful manner.</p>
<p>The best players in the biz conduct their own research, but if you don’t have access to that kind of data or the time to put it together, double down on the research process to put information together that people would otherwise have to spend hours to find on their own.</p>
<p>Remember, there’s no such thing as new information; every piece of media on the internet is a clever remix that people can’t help but go back to.</p>
<p>A few pro tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the data current, so your infographic can remain in circulation for a long time.</li>
<li>Present credible data, but make sure it doesn’t overwhelm the reader.</li>
<li>All the information should come together to tell a story.</li>
<li>The more unique your content, the more likely third parties are to publish it (a prelude to guestographics). The fresher the content, the more likely it is to be successful.</li>
<li>It always helps to create something that can be the <em><i>ultimate</i></em>guide on a specific topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808551"></a><b>2. </b><strong><b>Tell a Story With Your Infographics</b></strong></h2>
<p>Yes, we’ve alluded to it above, but you’d be gravely mistaken if you thought that was all there was to it when it comes to the world of <strong><b>data storytelling</b></strong>—there’s even a fancy word for it!</p>
<p>So you have your involved data points and what you want to explain, but how do you prevent the latter from drowning in the former? Data storytelling is like an artform that helps you weave together your primary narrative and your data points together seamlessly, making your infographics so much more useful and easier to follow, all while leaving them jam-packed with value additive content.</p>
<p>From a striking color palette and other visual elements to the content itself, every element interplays to create your story. Remember, humans are visual learners—so <em><i>how </i></em>you present data to them often matters far more than the substance of the data itself—that’s just how the cookie crumbles.</p>
<p>Need some more context? Check out these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the font and color scheme complement each other, and that the infographic sticks to them throughout.</li>
<li>Even the use of charts and boxes needs to conform to the larger aesthetic.</li>
<li>You can have different text in boxes for visual separation, but don’t make it too much of a departure.</li>
<li>Don’t crowd the infographic with too much information or too many visual elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a sample that does a really great job at all of the above metrics:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3154" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/POS-infographic.png" alt="An infographic that has a clear narrative." width="461" height="2129" /></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808552"></a><b>3. </b><strong><b>Publish Like a Pro</b></strong></h2>
<p>Your work doesn’t end when you’re done crafting the perfect infographic. If you really want it to get you those oh-so-important backlinks with guestographics/infographics, you need to perfect the publishing process, so people can easily link back to you, and so it’s super shareable and discoverable.</p>
<p>For let’s talk about publishing on your own website, and we’ll move to guestographics in the next section. Here’s a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a new page on your website for the infographic, so there’s a direct link to it.</li>
<li>Add a write-up alongside the infographic that serves as both the description, and the SEO optimized text that will help you rank for the appropriate searches on SERPs (If you’re posting it on other websites, change the write-up to match).</li>
<li>Add embed code so publications can add your infographic to their webpage inline, all while guaranteeing that there’s a direct route to your website.</li>
<li>Add social share buttons on the page so your infographic gains more traction.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to add a great call-to-action, telling readers to share your infographic—it guarantees more conversions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hit all of these metrics right, you can expect a ton of shares, and for your infographic to show up on Google Search and Image Search!</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808553"></a><b>4. </b><strong><b>Generating Backlinks With Guestographics</b></strong></h2>
<p>As big of a deal we make of getting backlinks, here’s something very few people will tell you. The formula for getting them isn’t hard at all. It’s as simple as taking a pinch of great content and adding the right kind of targeting outreach—alongside a great value proposition.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re already emailing hundreds of people on the daily to get more links to your infographic on your website, or even to get it featured on another site or social media feed. But we reckon you’re not getting a lot of link juice if you’re reading this.</p>
<p>If so, it’s time to pay a lot more attention to the words <strong><b>targeted</b></strong> and <strong><b>value proposition</b></strong>. You see, no one will want to feature your content if there’s nothing in it for them; even if the infographic is great, you have to grease some palms before people actually engage with you. Remember, most major platforms are already getting hundreds of people reaching out every day. What makes you different?</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of this infographic on SEO:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3155" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/in-house-infographic.png" alt="searchberg infographic on seo" width="382" height="2131" /></p>
<p>How do you ensure a ton of backlinks for it; we’re glad you asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by finding platforms that post exclusively about SEO—the more they’ve already covered the better.</li>
<li>Send them a <em><i>personalized</i></em>email where you refer to the editor by name, refer to already published content on their website, and then pitch your infographic as something that can augment their already great content (Pro-tip: Don’t be too pushy, ask them if they’d like to see it, don’t always attach it first).</li>
<li>But there’s more! Alongside, offer them even more value by saying you’ll write a mini guest post alongside; this really seals the deal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the best part, Google doesn’t always like links without surrounding text, but this method subverts that problem by adding a post around it. A win-win (Three times over!).</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808554"></a><b>5. </b><strong><b>The More Shareable the Better</b></strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3156" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social-platforms.png" alt="social media platforms next to a phone with an infographic" width="1121" height="747" /></p>
<p>There’s a ton of ways to make your infographic easily shareable, and all of them involve reducing the friction (or the time it takes) for a reader to take your infographic and get it on either their social feeds or their blogs.</p>
<p>Here’s a neat example; there’s a WordPress plugin called <a href="https://sumo.com/app/image-sharer"><u>Image Sharer by Sumo</u></a> that allows you to add floating social media buttons on all your infographics. It’s a low effort way of guaranteeing that everyone who is inclined to share your post will do so.</p>
<p>And don’t worry, if you’re on a different CMS, there are probably a ton of plugins that you can use to achieve the same thing. And if you have the resources, you can even code your own!</p>
<p>But that’s just the tip of the iceberg; here are some more things you <em><i>need</i></em> to do to make your infographic more shareable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate an embed code for your infographic so all it takes for someone to share it is a small HTML tweak.</li>
<li>Submit your infographic to high DA (domain authority) infographic submission sites and reap the benefits of their platforms.</li>
<li>Use platforms like Quora and Reddit to really get buzz around your infographic.</li>
<li>Try to submit it to other platforms using the instructions in the previous section.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808555"></a><b>6. </b><strong><b>Types of Infographic Backlinks and How to Acquire Them</b></strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3157" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Infographics-laptop.png" alt="infographics surrounding a laptop with a backlink icon" width="500" height="402" /></p>
<p>This section is going to be information dense, but it’s also a vital one. To know how to get backlinks, you <em><i>need </i></em>to know what types of backlinks you can get. This will help you target platforms more effectively, and optimize your content accordingly too!</p>
<p>There are six primary types of backlinks you can get for infographics; here’s what they are and what you need to know about them:</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc71808556"></a>Links From Blog Comments</h3>
<p>These backlinks come either from you or a reader posting the infographic link in the comments of other blogs that cover a similar topic to what your infographic covers.</p>
<p>They’re a really high traffic driver because people love soliciting other people’s opinions on content pieces they loved, so they’re sure to peruse the comments at least once.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc71808557"></a>Links From Topic Specific Forums</h3>
<p>Yes, this also includes platforms like Reddit and Quora. People who look for specific answers to specific problems, or people who love a certain topic are very likely to click through to links that will help them.</p>
<p>And yes, while most of these will be nofollow links, they will generate more traffic to your website.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc71808558"></a>Links From Guestographics</h3>
<p>We won’t dwell on this because it’s been covered above, but remember that you have an ulterior motive when writing your guest post; try to include an author bio section at the end so people know where the infographic came from.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc71808559"></a>Links From Google Image Search</h3>
<p>You can use Google Image Search to find out who’s using your infographic without linking to it; once you identify these people, send out a mass email asking them nicely to add a link so you don’t miss out on any quality backlinks.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc71808560"></a>Directory Links</h3>
<p>Again, we’ve talked about this once above; it’s a tried and tested way of getting links from sites that probably have a much bigger reach than yours.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc71808561"></a>Editorial Links</h3>
<p>This is your white whale, and just like Melville’s <em><i>Moby Dick</i></em>, it’s going to be a tough one to catch. You might have to invest in first-hand research, and you’ll have to put your best foot forward for industry giants to use your infographics in their content. The payoff is more than worth it, though.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808562"></a><b>7. </b><strong><b>It’s All in the Outreach</b></strong></h2>
<p>Outreach isn’t a monolith; it’s every method you use to put your infographic out there. And you need to take an all-of-the-above approach when it comes to marketing.</p>
<p>From leveraging all of your socials to the guestographics method described above, as well as regular email outreach to your existing subscribers, you need to fire on all cylinders. The best of the best have entire outreach times that are dedicated to finding link opportunities, while also optimizing infographics for organic SEO.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have the budget for that, reach out to the professionals!</p>
<div class="blog-cta style3">
<h3>Want to ensure that your infographic has a sizable reach and brings in a ton of traffic? Fill the form below.</h3>
<div class="inner">[blog_form1]</div>
</div>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808563"></a><b>8. </b><strong><b>A Smart Approach to Collecting Data</b></strong></h2>
<p>Finding the right data is a matter of knowing where to look, and finding data that really jumps out at readers.</p>
<p>To dwell on the latter, let’s look at two examples:</p>
<p><strong><b>22% of marketers use Facebook to increase sales</b></strong></p>
<p>vs.</p>
<p><strong><b>22% of marketers claim that Facebook has increased sales two-fold</b></strong></p>
<p>Is the difference clear to you? It’s night and day for most people. The latter is specific, and mentions a metric that business owners really care about. The first is vague, and holds no special interest for any group of people.</p>
<p>Second, really hone in on official sources that hold a lot of credibility. This means going down the Google Scholar rabbit hole, official sources with .edu or .org in their URL, and even studies commissioned by other players in your industry who aren’t competitors.</p>
<p>The goal is to gather a vast array of data points that all complement each other, allowing you to build on the primary message behind your infographic in succession.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808564"></a><b>9. </b><strong><b>An Eye For Good Design</b></strong></h2>
<p>We’re not going to beat around the bush; 50% of marketers primarily use visual marketing in their content, but 24% of them say that design is their biggest challenge. There’s no getting around it, people appreciate visual content more than ever, and they’re hypersensitive to bad aesthetic.</p>
<p>Your infographics thus need to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cohesive style when it comes to color palette, text, and spacing.</li>
<li>Complementary visual elements that embody the same style ethos.</li>
<li>A logical flow that’s easy on the eyes and makes the infographic accessible.</li>
<li>Succinct text that doesn’t dwell, and makes the infographic punchy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3158" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aesthetically-pleasing-infographic.png" alt="infographic with a great design" width="403" height="2129" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc71808565"></a><b>10. </b><strong><b>Get Infographics Experts on Board</b></strong></h2>
<p>It really is in your best interests to hire infographics experts in the long-term. They can help you develop a long-term strategy that takes an omnichannel approach, while also optimizing for each platform keeping best practices in mind.</p>
<p>It’s a win-win scenario, because freeing up resources that would be otherwise spent on infographics will open you up to generating revenues using core business activities.</p>
