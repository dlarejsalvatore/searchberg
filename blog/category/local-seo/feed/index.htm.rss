<h2>Small Business Development: How Can You Improve Your New York Business In 2020?</h2>
<p>With the 3<sup>rd</sup>-largest economy, 13<sup>th</sup>-lowest corporate tax rate, and more than <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/2018-Small-Business-Profiles-NY.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">2 million small businesses</a> in the state of New York, there’s no denying that The Empire State provides tremendous opportunity for businesses to grow.</p>
<p>In 2018, the state’s GDP increased by 2.1% at <a href="https://apps.bea.gov/regional/bearfacts/action.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">$1.676 trillion</a> (third highest in the country).</p>

<p>According to a New York Small Business Profile, 2018 report by the US Small Business Administration, top industries in New York include:<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1982" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-York-employment-statistics-by-industry.png" alt="New York employment statistics by industry" width="977" height="610" /></p>

<h2><a name="_Toc49793547"></a>Knowing <u>When</u> To Grow</h2>
<p>There’s no denying that businesses need to look for way to be better, to become more efficient or to offer better products. But a lot of businesses hit the acceleration on growth and end up growing <em>too soon or too quickly. </em>Yes, there is such a phenomenon. And no, it’s not good.</p>
<div class="pro-tip">
<div class="left">
<h3>Sustainable growth</h3>
<p>is the name of the game. You grow at a rate that allows you to restrategize and reallocate your resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2053" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pro-tip-icon1.png" alt="" width="141" height="135" /></div>
</div>
<p>So how can you grow your NY business to take it to the next level? How does the evolving economic landscape translate into revenue for New York businesses? How can you sustain that growth to ensure your business thrives in the long run? We’ll also touch upon how online marketing and SEO play into this equation?</p>
<p>We’ve broken down the top strategies to help you kick things off!</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc49793548"></a> 1. Navigate NY Regulations</h3>
<p>If you’re a small business owner operating anywhere in New York, you need to comply with several local, state and federal laws and regulations. For instance, let’s say you own a restaurant in SoHo; you will need building permits, health permits, signage permits, etc. Research these laws carefully to avoid hefty penalties.</p>
<p>The good thing is, you have the SBA Office of Advocacy that provides information and guidance in addition to giving you a platform to voice your opinions as a small business. Furthermore, you can visit the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/category/advocacy-navigation-structure/legislative-actions/regulatory-alerts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Regulatory Alerts</a> page on the SBA website that offers updates that specifically affect small business owners. Here’s how you can <a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/apply-licenses-permits" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">apply for licenses and permits</a>.</p>
<p>Work closely with these state agencies to eliminate—or at the very least—reduce the regulatory burden.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1984" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/regulatory-alerts-New-York-businesses.png" alt="regulatory alerts for New York businesses" width="1005" height="803" /></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc49793549"></a> 2. Defining Your Target Market in New York<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1985" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-York-target-audience-how-to-grow-your-business.jpg" alt="New York target audience" width="701" height="409" /></h3>
<p><em>Who is your target audience?</em></p>
<p>If you don’t have a hyper-specific answer to this question, you’re never going to be able to grow as a business. You can’t be one of those brands that make “we target everyone” the slogan of their business. Because the truth is, if you’re targeting “everyone”, you’re targeting no one.</p>
<div class="pro-tip">
<div class="left">
<h3>Keep in mind;</h3>
<p>your business is evolving; consumer needs are evolving; what was relevant in 2015 is no longer relevant in 2020. Focus on specific geographical trends.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2054" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pro-tip-icon2.png" alt="" width="164" height="181" data-large_image_width="1289.3480662983425" data-large_image_height="1423" /></div>
</div>
<p>For example, certain trends making waves in New York are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rise in the fintech industry</li>
<li>Brooklyn algorithm startups</li>
<li>The rise of food tech startups</li>
<li>Big data and analytics</li>
<li>New Yorkers heading to the suburbs</li>
</ul>
<p>A few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for common characteristics among your current client base.</li>
<li>See who your competitors are targeting to identify a niche they’re <em>not </em>catering to.</li>
<li>Scan your social media pages to see the kind of people who engage with your business most.</li>
<li>Check Google Analytics to identify which social network drives the most traffic using the referral traffic report.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some questions you should be asking:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What does your company value?</em> &lt;take cue from here&gt;</li>
<li><em>What are your best selling products/services?</em></li>
<li><em>What is their age?</em></li>
<li><em>Where do they live?</em></li>
<li><em>What is their socioeconomic status?</em></li>
<li><em>What do they want? </em></li>
<li><em>What is their lifestyle?</em></li>
<li><em>What is their spending power and patterns?</em></li>
<li><em>What are the primary uses of your products/services?</em></li>
<li><em>What are the secondary uses of your products/services?</em></li>
<li><em>How long have they been customers?</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="pro-tip">
<div class="left">
<h3>Remember</h3>
<p>Identifying your target audience will help you and your marketing team create more focused messages that will have an impact. The more structured and thorough your listing is, the more likely it is for your business to appear in the Google 3-Pack.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2054" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pro-tip-icon2.png" alt="" width="164" height="181" /></div>
</div>
<h3><a name="_Toc49793550"></a> 3. Play Up that Unique Selling Proposition (USP)<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1988" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thinking-outside-the-box-to-make-your-NY-business-grow.jpg" alt="thinking outside the box to make your NY business grow" width="316" height="421" /></h3>
<p>There may be an immediate success when you replicate an existing business model. Your competitor in Tribeca creates a clothing line for kids. You recognize there’s growth potential there; no denying it.</p>
<p>It’s safe, it has a proven track record, and it works.</p>
<p>So you introduce a kids’ clothing line too. After all, you need to catch up, right? But there’s no USP here. There’s nothing that makes YOU different. In order to expand your NY business, you don’t just have to catch up; you need to <em>stay ahead of the game</em>.</p>
<p>Your USP—your brand identity—does that for you.</p>
<p>Instead of another kids’ clothing line, how about <em>environmentally-friendly, zero-allergen</em> clothing line? You just knocked that one right out of the park!</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3><a name="_Toc49793551"></a> 4. Split Test Your Marketing Strategies</h3>
<p>AKA A/B testing lets you try out different strategies to identify which marketing idea yields the most returns or conversions.</p>
<p>Your website or social media page may be attracting traffic. <em>But is it converting? </em>Is it translating into dollars?</p>
<p>Let say you launch a new website; does the “<strong>Yay, Let’s Shop</strong>” CTA button perform better than the “<strong>Buy Now</strong>” CTA?<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1989" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/two-web-design-templates-with-different-CTAs-to-illustrate-greater-convertibility.jpg" alt="two web design templates with different CTAs to illustrate greater convertibility" width="801" height="861" /></p>
<p>Other ideas you could run A/B testing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of the CTA: Bigger isn’t always better. And less isn’t always more.</li>
<li>Free shipping information</li>
<li>Pricing display</li>
<li>Color and placement of the CTA</li>
<li>Kind of images</li>
<li>Navigation menu</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use Google Analytics to initiate, run, and manage these experiments.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc49793552"></a>5. Create a Winning Social Media Marketing Strategy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">72% of Americans</a> use social media today. <em>Seventy-two</em>.</p>
<p>That’s a lot by any standard.</p>
<p>Small businesses haven’t let this alarming statistic go by unnoticed.</p>
<p>As a quick, easy, and dirt cheap way to engage with a wide audience, social media is a clear winner any way you look at it. It’s no wonder that <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/77-percent-of-us-small-businesses-use-social-media-for-sales-marketing-and-customer-service-300704921.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">77% of small businesses in the U.S.</a> have a social media marketing strategy in place.</p>
<p>You don’t need to follow suit; there are already way too many brands doing that and regurgitating run-of-the-mill strategies. Cookie-cutter social media tactics will throw your business in the rubble instead of making it stand out.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to do to get people talking about your NY business (for the right reasons) and maximize engagement.</p>
<p>Start by creating a unique, genial, and unforgettable <strong>brand identity</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at why this matters.</p>
<p>Think “glazed goodness” and visuals of Krispy Kreme donuts crowd your mind. That’s impeccable product quality for you.</p>
<p>However, the company isn’t just known for its mouthwatering sweet delights; it’s also recognized for its witty, empathetic, and all-round feel-good brand identity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Went to a <a href="https://twitter.com/krispykreme?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@krispykreme</a> today for the BOGO promotion and was denied because I’m not a teacher.</p>
<p>— Bryan Carpenter (@bryan_carpenter) <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_carpenter/status/1293299586992308225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">So I guess this is now a <a href="https://twitter.com/krispykreme?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@krispykreme</a> stan account. <a href="https://t.co/VMoKqv58MM">pic.twitter.com/VMoKqv58MM</a></p>
<p>— Grotto Gear (@GrottoGear) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrottoGear/status/1299453707302719492?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Notice how their social media strategy checks off <em>all</em> the boxes: timely, remedial, quick-witted, good-humored, and personalized.</p>
<p>Instead of copy-pasting a generic response—“We’re so sorry this happened. Please email us so we can set things right”—they go the extra mile to make customers feel special.</p>
<p>If you scroll through their page, you’ll marvel at the consistency and quality of their social media activity.</p>
<p><em>And it doesn’t stop there.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1992" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Krispy-Kreme-New-York-Instagram-marketing-strategy.png" alt="Krispy Kreme’s New York-based Instagram marketing strategy" width="1057" height="394" /></p>
<p>Their social media pages stand out for their winning <strong>New York-friendly optimization strategies</strong>. The company recently opened a flagship store in New York and optimized their social media updates accordingly by using NYC-based hashtags to target local customers.</p>
<p>If you run a small business, doing grand reveals may be out of the question.</p>
<p><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-you-do-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Optimize your social media pages</a> by using relevant hashtags, providing ample links, posting engaging polls, and launching small-scale giveaways.</p>
<p>The outcome?</p>
<p>Impressive audience engagement and retention—each of which is essential for your small business development.</p>
<p>Infuse each post with hints of your brand identity to connect with your audience and humanize your brand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Consistency is key here</em></strong>. As long as you check off all these boxes and keep your pages up and running in the long run, you’ll continue to generate more leads.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc49793554"></a>6. Leverage SEO</h3>
<p>New York SEO services are a goldmine for local businesses. In fact, we’d go so far as to say they’re your golden ticket to consistent and measurable growth.</p>
<p>So how do you do SEO in New York? Before we get into it, let’s unpack the basics.</p>
<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of creating and optimizing content to attract more traffic (customers) and <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/8-crucial-google-ranking-factors-you-shouldnt-ignore-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rank higher on Google</a>.</p>
<p><em>Sounds like a mouthful?</em></p>
<p>In other words, it’s a neat trick to help your content become more visible on the web.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How does that help?</span></em></p>
<p>As more people view your content, they’re <em>more</em> likely to engage with it and take a desired business action (buy your products/services, follow your social media pages, sign up for emails, etc.).</p>
<p>Let’s switch to customer mode to gauge how SEO does the trick. Let’s say you’re a customer looking for IT services in New York. Here are the top results you’d get from a quick Google search:<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-search-results-for-IT-services-in-New-York.png" alt="top search results for IT services in New York" width="712" height="629" /></p>
<p>Notice how each landing page is meticulously optimized for location—New York, in this case. From the title tag (the main heading) to the meta description (the 1–3-line descriptor of the title), each page element includes location-friendly keywords.</p>
<p>This is a masterclass in <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/seo-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local SEO for New York</a>.</p>
<p>It’s quick, it’s easy, and it <em>works like a charm</em>.</p>
<p>With over 75% of people refusing to scroll past the first page of search results—who has the time, right?—local SEO propels your page to the top.</p>
<p>The outcome? More impressions, clicks, and conversions.</p>
<p><em>Done and dusted?</em></p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>In fact, this only scratches the surface.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to do to set yourself apart from your competitors and <strong><u>keep your business growing</u></strong> in the long run.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1995" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Google-Trends-New-York.png" alt="Google Trends New York" width="1200" height="423" /></p>
<p>If your audience is based in New York, their search preferences will be customized accordingly.</p>
<p>From “plumbing services in the Bronx” and “hiking gear in Manhattan” to “best natural supplements near me” and “home office chairs in New York,” the search queries will be <em>hyper-specific</em> and <em>relevant</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to maximize your reach, your keyword research strategy should be top-notch.</p>
<p>This is where Google Trends comes in.</p>
<p>The platform is amazing. It offers you a glimpse into the top trends for a specific location and further splinters them into relevant categories—news, events, entertainment, etc., you name it! With a few clicks, you can get an overview of what your target audience is interested in.</p>
<p>Here’s how this information works in your favor:</p>
<p>As you keep up with customer interest, you can create new content accordingly, tweak your product/service pages, and create location pages to maximize reach.</p>
<p>If Google Trends isn’t cutting it for you, get in touch with keyword specialists who know the ins and outs of each industry in New York and can help your business gain an edge.</p>
<p>Here are some stellar examples of how to fuse region-specific keywords with local trends to drive engagement:<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1996" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/screenshot-of-search-results-featuring-content-created-around-local-trends.png" alt="screenshot of search results featuring content created around local trends" width="617" height="541" /></p>
<p>From focusing on work-from-home to COVID-19 to Taylor Swift’s trending album “Folklore,” these brands have <em>expertly</em> identified key trends and married them with the moneymaking local keyword “New York.”</p>
<p>A recipe for success, and one that isn’t too complex to recreate.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1997" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Google-Trends-homepage.png" alt="Google Trends homepage " width="1278" height="1379" /></p>
<p>Depending on your industry, create a winning strategy that combines these two key factors. Cover different kinds of content, including blogs, articles, infographics, and press releases.</p>
<p>Sprinkle some keyword magic onto your product/service pages as well to maximize your chances of landing the <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/what-is-googles-local-3-pack-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-rank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google 3-Pack</a>—the top three search results on Google.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc49793587"></a>7. Use Google My Business to Grow Your Business Online</h3>
<p>Ever caught yourself wondering whether online reviews <em>actually</em> matter?</p>
<p>You’ve heard about their popularity. You’ve also heard that your business should be backed up by powerful testimonials and reviews that influence potential customers. But do they actually live up to the hype, or is it all big talk?</p>
<p><strong><u>Let’s dive deeper</u></strong>.</p>
<p>According to research, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/business/resources/improve-your-profile/improve-business-profile-google/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">88% of people</a> take reviews into consideration when making a buying decision.</p>
<p><em>That’s not all.</em></p>
<p>A staggering <a href="https://www.powerreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PowerofReviews_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">82% of customers</a> actively look for negative reviews to determine whether they should proceed with a purchase or look for alternatives.</p>
<p>Reviews—both positive and negative—can respectively <strong><u>make or break your business</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Leave negative reviews/mentions be without taking remedial action and your sales will take a dip. Fail to adequately solicit positive reviews and you’ll notice that your conversions aren’t as high as you’d like them to be.</p>
<p>So how do you close this Pandora’s box? And how do you strike the perfect balance between maximizing positive reviews and minimizing negative reviews?</p>
<p>You turn to Google My Business.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1999" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Google-My-Business-homepage.png" alt="Google My Business homepage" width="869" height="569" /></p>
<p>The powerful platform is the <em>crème de la crème</em> of online review platforms.</p>
<p>By claiming and optimizing your listing, you can engage more customers, maximize positive reviews, effectively respond to negative reviews, and get your business on the map.</p>
<p>In short, it’s a surefire way to grow a small NY business organically.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can start off on the right foot.</p>
<p>Make sure your listing is accurately filled and updated. From the name, address, and phone number (NAP) to the URL, business hours, and categories, <strong><u>each</u></strong> detail should be checked off to a tee.</p>

<p>Not only are the essentials perfectly filled out, but they’ve also taken care of additional details—including the FAQs.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, <strong><u>cover as many bases as possible</u></strong>.</p>
<p>The more structured and thorough your listing is, the more likely it is for your business to appear in the Google 3-Pack.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2003" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Google-3-Pack-for-the-best-hair-salons-in-New-York.png" alt="Google 3-Pack for the best hair salons in New York" width="703" height="847" /></p>
<p>If you take a closer look at the 3-Pack for the search query “best hair salons in New York,” you’ll notice that all the details are meticulously filled in and the ratings are stellar.</p>
<p>As you accumulate more positive reviews on the platform, you’ll rank higher on local search engine result pages (SERPs).</p>
<p>To maximize flattering reviews, make sure you verify your business, actively request reviews, and keep your listing updated.</p>
<p>When it comes to tackling negative reviews, adopt an empathetic and remedial approach. Take your time to understand the complaint, adequately make up for it, and follow up with the customer once the issue has been resolved.</p>
<p>Little do you know, you could end up turning a negative review into a positive one with timely, supportive, and amiable resolution!</p>

<p>No matter who your target audience is—Gen X, millennials, Gen Z, or baby boomers—creating a mobile-friendly website should be your top priority.</p>
<p>Let’s face it.</p>

<p>It does for the 19 million inhabitants of New York as well.</p>
<p>Create and optimize a seamless and eye-catching mobile-friendly website to grow your business fast. You’ll be taken aback by the much-needed boost in impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc61433182"></a>Delving Into a Local SEO Strategy in 2020</h2>
<p>If you run a local business, we can take a guess at what your search history looks like:</p>
<p><em>“How can I increase local traffic?”</em></p>
<p><em>“How can I improve rankings for local SEO?”</em></p>
<p><em>“How can I rank in the <strong><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/what-is-googles-local-3-pack-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-rank/">Google 3-Pack</a></strong>?”</em></p>
<p>Sounds about right?</p>
<p>All these search queries fall under the umbrella term <strong>“<u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/local-seo-services/">local SEO</a></u>.”</strong> In other words, if you master local SEO, you pretty much cover all the bases and save yourself the trouble of running a dozen individual search queries.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc61433183"></a>What is Local SEO?</h2>
<p>If you run a small business that’s restricted to a certain location (neighborhood, town, city, country, or state), local SEO ensures that your marketing efforts will be strategically targeted at individuals within that region.</p>
<p>Let’s say you run an electronics e-commerce store in Atlanta. Since your clientele is based in Atlanta, marketing to consumers in Savannah or Augusta would defeat the purpose of your campaign.</p>
<p>Instead of optimizing your business for <em>generic</em> search results, you need to optimize it for <em>local</em> search.</p>
<p>Local SEO helps you do just that by making your products/services/content visible to a wide local audience.</p>
<p>As you attract local visitors, you’ll generate high-quality traffic and <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/conversion-rate-optimization/">increase your conversion rate</a></u>. And while focusing your efforts on local SEO makes complete sense conceptually, its practical efficacy has been proven time and again.</p>
<p>According to research:</p>
<ul>
<li><u><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/search/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search-download/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">4 in 5 consumers</a></u> want search engines to offer localized results</li>
<li><u><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/mobile-search-trends-consumers-to-stores/https:/www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/mobile-search-trends-consumers-to-stores/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">76% of consumers </a></u>who run a local search on their phone end up visiting the business within 24 hours</li>
<li><u><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/local-search-mobile-search-micro-moments/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2 out of 3 smartphone users</a></u> are more likely to purchase from a business that offers a mobile-friendly site with customized information based on their location</li>
<li>Mobile searches for local businesses have recently grown by a whopping <u><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data/near-me-searches-search-open-now/" rel="nofollow">200%</a></u></li>
</ul>
<p>Last year, we compiled a <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/local-seo-in-2019-heres-what-you-need-to-primarily-focus-on/">local SEO checklist for 2019</a></u>. From touching upon the importance of leveraging <strong><u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/gmb-optimization/">Google My Business</a></u></strong> to discussing the significance of online reviews, we covered all the bases that were relevant in 2019.</p>
<p>Of course, there have been many changes since.</p>
<p>Local SEO isn’t a stagnant strategy; it’s constantly evolving and taking new shape based on current trends, consumer patterns, and algorithm changes.</p>
<p>To help you get a good grasp on how to do local SEO in 2020, we’ve compiled an updated checklist that focuses on how to perform local SEO and how to optimize your website for local search keeping in mind 2020 developments. Use our definitive guide to local SEO in 2020when creating a winning strategy for your small business, startup, or corporation.</p>
<p><em>Let’s dive in!</em></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc61433184"></a>10 Local SEO Tips for 2020: Key Tips on How to Rank Locally</h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc61433185"></a>1. Create Location-Friendly Content</h3>
<p>If there’s one local SEO strategy that can be implemented right away (while reaping powerful results), it’s <strong><u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/content-marketing/">local content creation</a></u></strong>. In fact, we’d go so far as labeling it the crème de la crème of local SEO.</p>
<p>The reasoning is simple.</p>
<p>Web users are smart; they understand that running a generic search will most likely fetch results that may not be of relevance. If a consumer in <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/seo-los-angeles/">Los Angeles</a></u> is on the lookout for modern furniture, their search query will be <em>highly</em> specific. The last thing they want is to fall in love with a gorgeous pair of sectionals, only to find out that the business is based in an entirely different state.</p>
<p>Over the years, trial and error has played its hand in helping consumers understand the workings of the game.</p>
<p>Instead of simply searching for <em>“modern furniture,”</em> a Los Angeles-based consumer is more likely to search for <em>“modern furniture in Los Angeles.”</em></p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of the search results for this specific query:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2425" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2.png" alt="query" width="1053" height="1885" /></a></p>
<p>Notice how each title tag includes the geographic keyword <em>“Los Angeles.”</em> In fact, if you pay close attention, you’ll realize that the meta descriptions also include the location.</p>
<p>It’s evident that these businesses have optimized their website for local search. This neat trick is a great way to <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/get-ranked-high-in-2020-6-proven-seo-strategies-for-small-businesses-and-startups/">climb search engine result pages (SERPs)</a></u> and sneak your way into the Google 3-Pack.</p>
<p>According to research, <u><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/first-page-google/#:~:text=75%25%20of%20people%20will%20never,worth%20your%20time%20and%20money." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">75%</a></u> of web users never scroll past the first SERP. And even if your business climbs SERPs and eventually earns a spot on the first page, the work doesn’t end there. In fact, the competition on the first page is ruthless.</p>
<p>The top five search results receive <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/10/30/the-value-of-search-results-rankings/#19c5253344d3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">67.6%</a></u> of clicks, whereas the remaining five receive less than <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/10/30/the-value-of-search-results-rankings/#19c5253344d3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">3.73%</a></u>. Optimizing product/service pages and preexisting content for location is a great way to dominate the top local search results.</p>

<div class="pro-tip">
<div class="left">
<h3>Incorporate local keywords into</h3>
<p>URLs, title tags, meta descriptions, H1–H4 headings, image filenames, image alt tags, and the body of the text.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2160" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pro-tip-icon.png" alt="" width="121" height="146" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In addition, create new location-friendly content to build a wide local audience. For instance, if you sell wrought iron and steel doors in certain states, create content centered on those locations. Your local SEO content creation strategy should include: Blogs Articles Guest Posts Press Releases Infographics and Instructographics Videos OUAI’s local pages are a great example of going about this the right way! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-1901" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OUAI’s-local-pages.png" alt="OUAI’s local pages" />
<p>We also suggest getting creative and coming up with unique content based on local trends, events, pop culture references, and holidays.</p>
<p>Keep your audience in mind to ensure you don’t end up alienating them for the sake of location-friendliness.</p>
<p>For instance, if you offer home downsizing services for senior citizens, creating content around Gen Z-friendly local events wouldn’t make much sense. Instead, do your research and compile a list of trends that align with the interests of your demographic.</p>
<p>Keep making adjustments to ensure relevance with time.</p>
<p>Expert <strong><u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/seo-keyword-research/">local keyword research</a></u></strong> will help your website get a much-needed boost on SERPs.</p>
<p>In addition, keep a laser-sharp focus on consistency to avoid a potential dry spell. The local SEO landscape is fiercely competitive; if you fail to produce consistent and impactful content, it’s very likely that your SERP rankings will begin to fall.</p>
<p><u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/glennllopis/2016/08/29/three-strategies-to-break-free-from-complacency/#6a264b0a3d13" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steer clear of complacency</a></u> and stay on your toes to ensure you maintain a winning online presence for local search in the long run.</p>

<p>Smartphones are easy-to-use, accessible, and compact. While their popularity is currently at an all-time high, it’s expected to grow further in 2021.</p>
<p>If you haven’t created a <strong><u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/responsive-mobile-design/">mobile-friendly website</a></u></strong>, you’re potentially losing out on a large number of local customers who solely use smartphones to purchase products/services online.

<p>Curious about how to optimize your website for local SEO in 2020?

<p>Set up your profile and ensure NAP (name, address, and phone number) consistency to help Google rank your business. As one of the most essential ranking signals, accurate and consistent NAP citations lend legitimacy and authority to your website.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed your profile, your business will appear on Google Maps within a couple of days.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of what your listing should look like:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-1939" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Untitled-2.png" alt="" />
<p>Update and optimize your listing on a weekly basis to inch your business closer to the Google 3-Pack.</p>
<p>We suggest checking out our previous blog to familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/how-to-optimize-google-my-business-listing-and-leverage-it-for-more-sales/">how to optimize your Google My Business listing</a></u>.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc61433188"></a>4. Build Local Backlinks</h3>
<p>While you may be familiar with the importance of building quality backlinks, local SEO takes things a step further.</p>
<p>Instead of simply leveraging link building, focus on <strong><em><u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/link-building-service/">local link building</a></u></em></strong>.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>It’s simple. Each time you receive a backlink from a website with <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/high-domain-authority/">high domain authority</a></u>, draft an email requesting them to include your location in the anchor text. This will improve the quality and value of the backlink, resulting in better rankings and increased traffic.</p>
<p>We suggest informing them about the benefits of making the content more location-friendly for their business as well. This is more likely to help you receive a response in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Communicate the same concern to your backlink building partners so they can include your business location in the anchor text each time they offer you a backlink in the future.</p>
<p>If you’re new to link building, we suggest checking out the following blogs for a quick overview of the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/10-advanced-link-building-tips-and-tricks-to-boost-your-seo/">10 Advanced Link Building Tips and Tricks to Boost Your SEO</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/a-marketers-guide-to-the-powerful-benefits-of-consistent-link-building/">A Marketer’s Guide to the Powerful Benefits of Consistent Link Building</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And while building backlinks is important, improving your internal linking structure is equally imperative.</p>
<p>Each time you produce new content, link to earlier blogs/articles/product pages/service pages and include local keywords. This is especially recommended for the CTA.</p>
<p>The simple yet powerful trick is a great way to help your content become more visible for local search. The outcome? A much-needed boost in local traffic and rankings.</p>







<h3><a name="_Toc61433189"></a>5. Optimize Your Website for Local Voice Search</h3>
<p><strong>Local voice search</strong> is the newest player in the game that’s easily becoming a top contender.</p>
<p>According to Google, <u><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data/voice-search-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">20%</a></u> of all searches on Google are done by voice.</p>
<p>That’s <em>a lot</em> of searches.</p>
<p>Luckily, you don’t need to do much to optimize your website for local voice search. Voice queries are very similar to regular search terms. Of course, they tend to be a bit longer and more natural. For instance, a regular search term like <em>“best pizza place in Ohio”</em> would probably be modified to <em>“what’s the best pizza place in Ohio that’s open right now”</em> if spoken.</p>
<p>Use <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/04/06/striking-seo-gold-with-schema-markup-and-rich-snippets/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">schema markup</a></u> (also known as structured data) to help Google organize and categorize your content accordingly. It may sound complex, but it’s a piece of cake.</p>
<p>In short, schema markup is data about the information on your website. While your audience will not see it, search engines will use this information to understand your content better and crawl, index, and rank it accordingly.</p>
<p>Ultimately, schema markup helps Google fetch more relevant and informative search results for web users. We recommend getting in touch with local SEO professionals who can do the work for you. It doesn’t take long, but makes a <em>big</em> difference in helping Google classify essential information, including your business hours, phone number, address, directions, etc.</p>





<div class="pro-tip">
<div class="left">
<h3>Each time a web user</h3>
<p>runs a relevant voice search, Google will effectively pull your listing out of the directory and include it in the search results.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2161" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pro-tip-icon2.png" alt="" width="136" height="142" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another great way to optimize your website for voice search is by building a stellar Google My Business profile. Choosing the right categories and ensuring consistency across the board will help your business appear in the top results for voice search. As stated above, the local SEO strategies for voice search are very similar to those for regular search so there’s no way you can go wrong here.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc61433190"></a>6. Request Reviews on “The Big Three”</h3>
<p>Local online reviews are a goldmine for businesses.</p>
<p>We emphasized the significance of reviews in our earlier blog and can’t help but pay homage to this brilliant strategy in 2020 as well. It’s timeless and won’t lose its shine irrespective of how many new strategies enter the local SEO game in the future.</p>
<p>According to research, <u><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/973413/most-important-attributes-online-shopping-shoppers-usa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">53%</a></u> of Americans rely on product/service reviews and ratings to guide their online shopping experience. In fact, reviews can boost the conversion rate by a whopping <u><a href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/_pdf/Spiegel_Online%20Review_eBook_Jun2017_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">380%</a></u>.</p>
<p>While reviews are still just as important today as they were a few years ago, there have been certain alterations. Currently, reviews hold the most weightage if received on “the big threes”—<strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, and <strong>Yelp</strong>.</p>
<p>While reviews on other social media platforms play a big role in shaping audience opinion and improving brand identity, they don’t directly impact rankings.</p>
<p>Of course, receiving great reviews on Google is your golden ticket to entering the Google 3-Pack. However, reviews on Facebook and Yelp also heavily impact rankings, though not as directly as Google.</p>
<p>We suggest requesting reviews on each platform and <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeslacouncil/2019/03/04/five-ways-to-build-a-strong-online-presence-for-your-brand/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">maintaining a strong online presence</a></u> to ensure customers have a positive experience.</p>
<p>However, avoid going overboard by spamming or heavily incentivizing customers. Instead, share a link to the review form on social media, Google My Business, and in the CTAs.</p>
<p>A balanced approach will help you <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/8-reasons-to-protect-your-brands-online-reputation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">generate reviews</a></u> without putting off your customers. It’ll also give your Google listing a much-needed boost.</p>
<p>Each time a web user searches for location-specific products/services in your industry, <em>your</em> listing will show up (if you’ve mastered local SEO, that is). And as they browse through your listing, the reviews will vividly stand out.</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse of what we’re talking about:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-3.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2429 size-full" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-3.png" alt="the Google Local 3-Pack for Search Berg" width="430" height="1325" /></a></p>
<p>By doubling down on reviews—especially on Google, Facebook, and Yelp—you’ll manage to maintain a pristine brand identity and make it easier for web users to feel like they can trust your company and do business with you.</p>
<p>When the reviews are good and plentiful, web users won’t have to look elsewhere; they’ve already found exactly what they’re looking for!</p>
<p>Ultimately, excellent customer service will help you dominate the web for local search and grow your business in the long run. Pull out our comprehensive guide to local SEO in 2020 when you’re about to create a winning strategy. It’ll help you check off all the right boxes and start off on the right foot.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc61433191"></a>7.Maintain a Stellar Social Media Presence</h3>
<p>You can’t master local SEO without focusing on social media.</p>
<p>Take a quick look at Setton Consulting’s Twitter post:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-4.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2430" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-4.png" alt="Seatton Consulting’s location-friendly tweet for New York customers" width="580" height="423" /></a></p>
<p>They’ve strategically used #NewYork to reach a geo-specific portion of their target audience: New York-based businesses that are looking for IT support.</p>
<p>USA Electric uses a very similar approach:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-5.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2431" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-5.png" alt="USA Electric’s location-friendly tweet for Los Angeles customers " width="588" height="428" /></a></p>
<p>By using #LosAngeles in their Twitter post, they’re targeting Los Angeles-based homeowners who are looking for electrical support. By leveraging social media, these companies are excelling at reaching local customers.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can use this strategy like a seasoned pro.</p>
<p>Make a list of <strong><u>all the locations</u></strong> your business serves. Your list may include a handful of cities or several states depending on the size and reach of your business.</p>
<p>Once you have a list ready, dive deeper. Break states into cities, cities into towns, and towns into neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Once you’re done, highlight the most popular locations.</p>
<p>All set?</p>
<p><u>These are the locations you should specifically target on social media.</u></p>
<p>Use hashtags, incorporate them into social media images/videos and captions, and include them in your bio (if they’re a handful of standout locations).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-6.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2432" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-6.png" alt="patio furniture" width="593" height="393" /></a></p>
<p>As you optimize your social media pages for the specific locations your business serves, you’ll manage to reach the right audience. Share these location-friendly posts aggressively to build a wide local audience.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc61433192"></a>8.Improve Your Internal Linking Structure</h3>
<p>The large majority of companies that create local content fail to recognize the importance of working on their internal linking structure.</p>
<p>Sure, you’re written a <em>spectacular</em> location-specific blog. You’ve also shared it on social media. Is it time to let it organically gain traction now?</p>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Yes, let it organically gain traction.</p>
<p>No, can’t simply create a location-specific blog and call it a day.</p>
<p>Once you’ve generated local content, <em><u>actively incorporate it</u></em> into other blogs, articles, infographics, and related forms of content on your site. This is a great way to help local content continually generate traffic instead of eventually falling flat on its face after serving its purpose.</p>
<p>Keep the momentum going!</p>
<p>As you improve your internal linking structure, your local content will continually stay <em>fresh</em>.</p>
<p>The outcome? Better rankings, more traffic, and impressive local leads.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc61433193"></a>9.Ensure Seamless Reputation Management</h3>
<p>Local consumers are quick on their feet. One social media search and they can easily identify negative reviews for your business in their state, city, town, or neighborhood.</p>
<p>Search for “Dunkin Donuts Los Angeles” on Twitter and you’ll receive a plethora of tweets—some positive and some negative. And if the not-so-flattering tweets outweigh the positives, well, you may lose local customers.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re talking about:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-7.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2433" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blog2-7.png" alt="a negative customer review for Dunkin Donuts’ Los Angeles branch" width="588" height="262" /></a></p>
<p>All it takes is a straightforward “Dunkin Donuts Los Angeles” search to reveal social media posts that can be <em>detrimental to your business</em>.</p>
<p>So what do you do to turn things around?</p>
<p>You leverage <strong><u>reputation management services</u></strong>.</p>
<p>By helping you respond to negative comments the <em>right</em> way, remove inaccurate statements, and focus on the positives, reputation management experts can revamp your local online brand identity. Their aim is to counteract misleading trends and give you the chance to put your best foot forward.</p>
<p>These factors go a long way in helping you retain local customers.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc61433194"></a>10. Consistency, Consistency, Consistency!</h3>
<p>When it comes to local SEO, <strong><u>consistency is key</u></strong>.</p>
<p>If you launch a winning strategy, make sure you <em>continue to update it in the long run</em> as opposed to letting it run its course. Abandoning your strategy will quickly undo your efforts and take you back to square one.</p>
<p>If you’re willing to see consistent results, you <strong><em><u>have</u></em></strong> to be consistent with your strategy. Tweak it on a monthly basis for better reach, rankings, and overall performance. As long as you keep your strategy up and running, the results will continue to astound you in the long run!</p>

<p>As online marketing becomes the epicenter of <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/6-digital-marketing-tips-for-small-businesses-struggling-to-navigate-covid-19/">running a modern business</a>, there’s been a gradual departure from offline marketing strategies. While billboards, word-of-mouth, and television commercials may have done the trick in the last decade, they’ve lost their charm over the years.</p>



<p><span id="more-1752"></span></p>



<p>Instead, search engines now dominate the marketing landscape.</p>



<p>This means that if your business doesn’t have a strong digital presence, it’ll quickly be swept away by the massive storm of competition.</p>



<p>Here’s the thing; maintaining an online presence doesn’t cut it. Instead, you <em>have</em> to go the extra mile and <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/content-comprehensiveness-are-you-content-with-your-content/">optimize your content</a> to ensure it appears on the <strong><u>first</u></strong> search engine result page (SERP).</p>



<p><em>How do you go about this?</em></p>



<p>It’s simple. You familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of Google ranking factors.</p>



<p>If you’re new to rankings, check out <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/googles-most-important-ranking-factors-according-to-seo-industry-practices/">our previous blog</a> for a quick overview of local search ranking factors and essential on-page SEO ranking factors.</p>



<p>Once you’re done, head back to this blog and we’ll walk you through some of the most crucial Google ranking factors for 2020.</p>



<h2>1. High-Quality Backlinks</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1755" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog1.jpg" alt="graphic design illustrating link building " /></figure>
</div>



<p>There’s a reason why the term “backlinks” has become a household name in the SEO world. Whether you recently launched a startup or have been running a business for over a decade, leveraging backlinks is a surefire way to increase online visibility.</p>



<p>A backlink is an external hyperlink that redirects readers of a third-party website to your content (<a href="https://www.searchberg.com/product-description-writing-services/">product pages</a>/<a href="https://www.searchberg.com/service-page-writing-services/">services pages</a>/<a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog-writing-services/">blogs</a>/<a href="https://www.searchberg.com/article-writing/">articles</a>, etc.).</p>



<p>In short, it’s a goldmine for businesses that are struggling to appear on the first page of Google.</p>



<p>The process of <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/a-marketers-guide-to-the-powerful-benefits-of-consistent-link-building/">acquiring backlinks</a> is commonly known as “link building.” Lucky for you, we have a video detailing just that!</p>



<figure><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GwiI6V1eyQg?feature=oembed" width="770" height="433" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>



<p>Sounds like the perfect way to ensure your business dominates search results, right?</p>



<p>Well, there’s a catch.</p>



<p>While link building definitely plays a big role in <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/get-ranked-high-in-2020-6-proven-seo-strategies-for-small-businesses-and-startups/">boosting SERP rankings</a>, it’s not a one-size-fits-all strategy that can be leveraged to produce the same results.</p>



<p>There are many nuances that need to be mastered before you can sneak your way into the top search results on Google.</p>



<p>For starters, you need to make sure that you’re receiving backlinks from websites with <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/high-domain-authority/">high domain authority</a>, i.e. stellar ranking on SERPs. The score ranges from 1–100 and gives Google an idea of how reputable, trustworthy, and authoritative your website is.</p>



<p>Google’s algorithm works assiduously to analyze multiple on-page factors and determine where you stand.</p>



<p>For instance, Forbes has a domain authority score of 93. The higher the rating, the <em>better</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1757" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog3.jpg" alt="Forbes website domain authority " /></figure>
</div>



<p>If you receive a dofollow backlink from an established and trusted website like Forbes, you’ve struck gold. Not only will you receive an influx of high-quality traffic, but Google’s algorithm will also give you a much-needed boost in rankings.</p>



<p>And while backlink quality matters, backlink quantity is equally essential. Master the art of <strong>consistent link building</strong> so you can claim <em>and</em> retain your spot on the first SERP.</p>



<h2>2. Search Intent</h2>



<p>Google’s ranking algorithm is whip-smart. It cleverly ranks pages based on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/04/25/how-search-intent-can-be-the-foundation-of-a-successful-seo-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">search intent</a>.</p>



<p>For instance, if you’re looking to purchase shoes online in Miami, the algorithm will detect that you’re in “buying mode” right off the bat. Instead of receiving a cluster of different search results that leave you flustered, you’ll view a streamlined set of relevant pages.</p>



<p>Here’s a glimpse:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1758" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog4.jpg" alt="shoe store" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Notice how each page is tailored for web users who are in “buying mode” and interested in making a transaction.</p>



<p>Alternatively, if someone was interested in learning how to lace shoes, the algorithm would quickly pick up on that and offer results for web users in “learning mode”:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1759" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Communication.jpg" alt="shoe laces" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Each result includes the phrases “how to,” “ways,” or “methods” to help readers learn, as opposed to buy.</p>



<p>Of course, the page may include a clever <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">call-to-action</a> toward the end that prompts action. However, that’s not the main concern of the reader, and Google knows that.</p>



<p>As a marketer, you need to understand this distinction and create content accordingly.</p>



<p>Optimizing your page for search intent will ultimately help your business become a familiar sight on the first SERP. If you run a local business, you’ll manage to break into the coveted <strong><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/what-is-googles-local-3-pack-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-rank/">Google Local 3-Pack</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Here are some of the most effective <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/the-2020-seo-roadmap-for-small-businesses/">local SEO strategies for small businesses</a> to help you master the art of creating and optimizing content for local search.</p>



<h2>3. Winning Content That Consistently Stands Out</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1760" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Communication1.jpg" alt="man creating content on his laptop in a professional setting" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Ah, content. We doubt there will ever be a day when content isn’t one of the (if not “the”) best ways to rank higher on Google.</p>



<p>As we segue into the importance of <strong><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/why-content-driven-seo-is-the-ultimate-digital-marketing-strategy-for-2020/">producing winning content</a></strong>, it’s essential to note that search intent closely ties in with this ranking factor.</p>



<p>After all, you’re producing content <em>for</em> customers.</p>



<p>Throwing intent out of the mix will leave you with content that fails to achieve its purpose. Instead, keep a laser-sharp focus on what your audience wants and go the extra mile to supply it.</p>



<p>We suggest using Google Trends for staying abreast of the latest news updates, events, and happenings that are currently trending. Create content plans around these trends to give your audience exactly what they’re actively searching for.</p>



<p>In addition, create personalized pages for different demographics (e.g. age, location, etc.).</p>



<p>If you run a local clothing store in Arizona, it’s very likely that your target audience will run searches similar to “trendy clothes in Arizona,” “summer outfit trends Arizona,” “stunning outfits for teens Arizona.” Create a customized page for all major subsets of search intent.</p>



<p>Covering all bases will help your website actively circulate the web and appear in the results for hyper-specific search queries.</p>



<h2>4. Expert Keyword Research and Use</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1761" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fb1.jpg" alt="graphic design illustrating keyword research " /></figure>
</div>



<p>Even if you’re not a seasoned SEO pro and have been casually dabbling in the digital marketing landscape, we’re sure you’re still familiar with the make-it-or-break-it nature of keywords.</p>



<p>To cut to the chase, keywords have been long placed on the golden pedestal of SEO—and rightfully so. Expert keyword research can boost content from the 6<sup>th</sup> page of SERPs to the first.</p>



<p>But how should you go about it?</p>



<p>We recommend <strong>getting in touch with <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/seo-keyword-research/">keyword specialists</a></strong> who have extensive experience in researching relevant keywords for a wide range of industries. They’ll equip you with the top-ranking keywords in your niche so your content stands out instead of simply floating across odd SERPs on the web.</p>



<p>In addition, focus on incorporating the following keywords into your content:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Short-Tail Keywords:</strong> Short keywords comprising 2–3 words</li>
<li><strong>Long-Tail Keywords:</strong> Long and specific keywords comprising over 3 words</li>
<li><strong>Geo-Targeting Keywords:</strong> Keywords that target a specific location (e.g. neighborhood, town, city, state, country, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) Keywords:</strong> Conceptual terms that are closely related to the main keyword</li>
</ul>



<p>Use anchor text for your keywords, wherever possible, to ensure they stand out and prompt action. This is a great way to boost rankings and compel web users to invest in your products/services, engage with earlier content, or simply stick around longer!</p>



<p>Incorporate keyword-rich anchor text within the first 100 words of your content to increase your chances of appearing on the first SERP. Also known as <strong><u>keyword prominence</u></strong>, this nifty strategy will help your content rank higher.</p>



<p>In addition, be careful about <strong><u>keyword density</u></strong> to avoid going overboard and potentially getting penalized by Google. Keyword density is the percentage of keywords used as a factor of the total words appearing on the page.</p>



<p>For instance, if you write a 500-word blog and include 5 keywords, your keyword density is 1%. Ideally, we suggest opting for 2–4% keyword density to ensure your content appears on SERPs without risking the chance of overwhelming your audience or getting blacklisted.</p>



<p>Using white hat keyword research and use strategies is a great way to find the perfect balance.</p>



<p>Lastly, pay close attention to <strong><u>keyword proximity</u></strong>. This factor refers to the distance between each keyword.</p>



<p>Let’s say your keyword is “Los Angeles residential doors” and you incorporate it into your content as “Los Angeles doors for all your residential needs.”</p>



<p>The search term proximity between “Los Angeles” and “doors” is excellent since there are no interruptive words in between. However, the search term proximity between “doors” and “residential” is three words, which isn’t great.</p>

<p>Using keywords <em>as they are</em> as much as possible will help your website dominate the web!</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/searchberg-web-design-development-services/">website’s structure, design, and functionality</a> go a long way in helping Google’s algorithm effectively crawl, index, and rank your page(s).</p>



<p>Google has revealed on numerous occasions that the platform uses HTTPS as a ranking signal. In fact, Google’s Webmaster Trend Analyst, John Mueller, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1090196646200307712" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweeted the importance of HTTPS</a> by stating that it’s a “lightweight ranking factor [and has] great user for users.”</p>



<p>Our team at Search Berg couldn’t agree more.</p>



<p>Set up SSL on your website by getting in touch with an <strong><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/web-design-development-services/">expert web development team</a></strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, incorporate the following tips into your web design and development strategy to boost rankings:</p>



<ul>
<li>Use an SEO-friendly URL and always separate terms using hyphens (not underscores)</li>
<li>Opt for responsive, visually compelling, and user-friendly web design that enhances user experience and <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/how-website-seo-can-bring-your-new-website-high-rankings-increased-traffic-new-customers-and-more-leads/">pulls in quality traffic</a></li>

<li>Don’t use JavaScript excessively</li>
<li>Create a sitemap</li>

<h2>6. Mobile-Friendliness</h2>

<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1764" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fb4.jpg" alt="graphic design showing a woman participating in a mobile transaction" /></figure>
</div>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/70-of-internet-traffic-comes-from-mobile-phones/510120/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">70%</a></strong> of all internet traffic comes from smartphones</li>

</ul>



<p>In short, <strong><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/responsive-mobile-design/">ensuring mobile-friendliness</a></strong> is non-negotiable in 2020.</p>



<p>While you may have checked off all the boxes by creating a seamless and aesthetically pleasing desktop website, you’re sabotaging your business by sidelining mobile-friendliness.</p>



<p>In 2016, Google announced mobile-first indexing, which meant that a website’s compatibility (or lack thereof) with mobile would directly impact its rankings.</p>



<p>Previously, businesses would prioritize desktop web design and development.</p>



<p>Today, many businesses kick-start their online marketing projects by creating a seamless, user-friendly, and engaging mobile website.</p>



<p>If you haven’t yet, you may want to jump on the bandwagon stat.</p>



<p>Determine your site’s mobile-friendliness by checking the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9063469?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">“Mobile Usability”</a> report in Google Search Console. If things aren’t looking so good, you’ll have to make some major changes.</p>



<p>If you already have a mobile-friendly website, you can still use the platform to detect any issues and resolve them on an urgent basis.</p>



<p>We recommend ensuring each page on your site is perfectly optimized for mobile to prevent customer loss, especially if you run a local business.</p>



<h2>7. Schema Markup</h2>



<p>Using <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/04/06/striking-seo-gold-with-schema-markup-and-rich-snippets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">schema markup</a>, also known as schema code, is a great way to rank higher on Google. Needless to say, it’s one of the top ranking factors for 2020.</p>



<p>In short, schema markup informs search engines of the kind of content you’re producing. It helps them effectively understand certain information, including your company’s phone number, reviews, address, etc.</p>



<p>As one of the most effective <strong><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/small-business-seo/">small business SEO</a></strong> strategies, schema markup plays a big role in allowing search engines to fetch accurate and more informative results for web users.</p>



<p>Ensure your data markup is consistent with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">guidelines set by Google</a>.</p>



<p>At Search Berg, we have the resources, expertise, and experience to help your business rank higher by implementing a site-wide schema code.</p>



<h2>8. Domain Authority and Seniority</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1765" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fb5.jpg" alt="group of people have a discussion while using their electronic devices " /></figure>
</div>



<p>While we touched upon <strong><u>domain authority</u></strong> when outlining the importance of high-quality backlinks, we strictly discussed it with regard to link building.</p>



<p>Of course, ensuring you receive backlinks from a website with high domain authority is essential. However, it’s equally important to ensure <em>your</em> website has high domain authority.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1766" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GMB.jpg" alt="The Outcome" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Over the years, <strong><u>domain seniority</u></strong> has also emerged as a crucial ranking factor. The older your domain is, the better chance you have at tapping into the first SERP.</p>



<p>You may have noticed that domains that have been around for quite some time end up holding a coveted position on the first page of Google for much, <em>much</em> longer. In contrast, new domains struggle to rank for top keywords.</p>



<p>While you can improve your domain authority, there’s nothing you can do about domain seniority except wait, continue to produce powerful content, and let nature take its course.</p>



<p>In the meantime, here’s how you can increase your domain authority.</p>



<p>Struggling to rank higher on Google? We can help you get started. Our <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/local-seo-services/">local SEO</a> and <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/link-building-service/">link building specialist</a> are equipped with the insights, resources, expertise, and experience required to help turn your business around.</p>



<p>We focus on a wide range of Google ranking factors, local search ranking factors, and on-page SEO ranking factors to ensure your business climbs SERPs and lands in the Google Local 3-Pack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While digital marketing has been the cornerstone of running a successful local business for at least a decade, its importance has grown manifold in 2020.</p>



<p><span id="more-1645"></span></p>



<p><em>Why?</em></p>



<p>According to research, the <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/8-reasons-to-protect-your-brands-online-reputation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">COVID-19 lockdown</a> has pushed internet use by a whopping <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markbeech/2020/03/25/covid-19-pushes-up-internet-use-70-streaming-more-than-12-first-figures-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">70%</a>!</p>



<p>And that’s not all.</p>



<p>While the lockdown has begun to ease across many states, people are <em>still</em> spending an astounding amount of time browsing the web for local content/products/services.</p>



<p>If you’ve been overlooking the importance of digitalizing your business, you may want to jump on the bandwagon. And while adopting digitalization is a great way to get started, it’s not enough.</p>



<p>According to Forbes, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2017/08/30/how-to-optimize-your-seo-results-through-content-creation/#259f710b2aa3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">75%</a> of internet users never scroll past the first SERP (search engine result page).</p>



<p>If your content isn’t optimized, engaging, and gripping, it’s most likely to show up on the 12<sup>th</sup>, 13<sup>th</sup> or even 40<sup>th</sup> SERP. With an average attention span of <a href="https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">eight seconds</a>, people barely glance over the first page, let alone scour the remaining SERPs—so you better get optimizing.</p>



<p>What do you do to stand out from the crowd and make a stellar first impression?</p>



<p>It’s simple. You optimize your content for the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p><em>Sounds odd, doesn’t it?</em></p>



<p>We’ll help break things down so you can leverage the 3-Pack to rank locally on Google.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in!</p>



<h2>What is the Local SEO 3-Pack?</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1647" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Simply put, the Google 3-Pack is a listing of the top three search results for a local search.</p>



<p>While a regular search doesn’t include geographic keywords, a local search commonly includes the phrases “near me,” “close to me,” or “in [location].”</p>



<p>For instance, if you search for “Italian restaurants in Manhattan,” you’ll receive the following Google 3-Pack:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1648" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Similarly, if you search for “barbershop in Downtown Los Angeles,” you’ll see the following Google 3-Pack:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1649" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Notice how the 3-Pack covers every base to give internet users comprehensive—albeit concise—information about the most relevant, popular, and reputable local search results.</p>



<p>With a simple search, people can instantly access the following information about the top three businesses:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Introductory image</li>
<li>Map with personalized directions</li>
<li>Link to website</li>
<li>Rating</li>
<li>Number of reviews</li>
<li>Timings</li>
<li>Key features (e.g. dine-in, delivery, curbside pickup, etc.)</li>
</ul>



<p>If they choose to engage with the listing, they can view even more details, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Additional images</li>
<li>FAQs</li>
<li>Popular times</li>
<li>Detailed critic reviews and testimonials</li>
<li>Amenities</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Booking options</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, the Google 3-Pack is an efficient, accurate, and time-saving gold mine for local searchers.</p>



<p>Over the years, Google reduced the number of topmost local searches from seven to five. In 2015, the pack was further condensed by reducing five listings to three for enhanced convenience, ease, and relevance.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that the search results on the first page of Google generate a whopping <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/10/30/the-value-of-search-results-rankings/#38f75a0744d3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">92%</a> of organic traffic. In fact, the first result in the Google 3-Pack enjoys an enviable <a href="https://www.tytonmedia.com/blog/seo-statistics/#:~:text=Position%20%231%20in%20google%20enjoys%20a%2034.36%25%20CTR.&amp;text=On%20average%2C%20Google%20receives%20over,a%20video%20on%20your%20homepage." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">34.36%</a> CTR (click-through rate).</p>



<p>Customers are less likely to engage with results that show up underneath the Google 3-Pack. While search results on the first page that fall outside the 3-Pack still generate a lot of traffic, the second, third, and subsequent pages suffer from diminishing traffic generation.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1650" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>That’s why we’ve rounded up some of the most effective and whip-smart SEO strategies to help your business <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/get-ranked-high-in-2020-6-proven-seo-strategies-for-small-businesses-and-startups/">rank higher on Google Maps</a>, so it can show up on the coveted Google 3-Pack.</p>



<h2>How to Optimize for the Google 3-Pack?</h2>



<h3>1. Check Where You Currently Stand</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1651" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>It should come as no surprise that the Google 3-Pack appears <a href="https://www.seoclarity.net/how-googles-local-pack-update-has-reshaped-the-organic-landscape-12952/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">93%</a> of the time when people run a local search.</p>



<p>If you run a local business, optimizing your content to <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/getting-local-consumer-traction-by-ranking-up-on-google-maps-a-breakdown/">rank locally on Google</a> is essential. And checking where your business currently stands is a great way to kick things off.</p>



<p>While you may feel compelled to dive into the deep end of 3-Pack optimization, forgoing prior research could end up doing more harm than good.</p>



<p>Instead, we suggest consulting with SEO experts to determine whether your business appears in the top 20 local search results. This will help streamline and refine the optimization strategy for your business.</p>



<h3>2. Claim, Fill, and Optimize Your Google My Business Listing</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1652" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Leveraging Google My Business is one of the most effective ways to rank higher on Google Maps.</p>



<p>As Google’s own in-house platform, Google My Business makes it much easier for customers to find, access, and engage with your business.</p>



<p>If you haven’t claimed your free listing yet, we suggest tackling that task first by clicking <a href="https://business.google.com/create?gmbsrc=ww-ww-et-gs-z-gmb-v-z-h~bhc-core-u%7Cmybb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">here</a>. Simply enter your company’s name or add your business to Google if it isn’t already in the directory.</p>



<p>Once you’ve claimed your listing, take your time to fill out the required information. Take special care to ensure accuracy and relevance, as this information will potentially appear in the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p>You’ll be requested to share your company’s:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Website URL</li>
<li>Industry category</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Business hours</li>
<li>Types of payment accepted</li>
<li>Description</li>
</ul>



<p>The more information you provide, the greater your chances of showing up on the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p>Ensure NAP (name, address, phone number) consistency to lend legitimacy and credibility to your business. Any deviations could reduce the authority of your business and prevent customers from accessing information or finding your listing altogether.</p>



<p>Once you’ve filled in the relevant information, the <em>real work</em> begins.</p>



<p>Optimizing and updating your listing are two of the most impactful ways to help your business climb SERPs.</p>



<p>Share high-resolution images and upload photos on a weekly basis to ensure relevance and keep your audience engaged. According to Google, businesses with photos enjoy <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6335804?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">42%</a> more requests for directions to their location and <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6335804?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">35%</a> more clicks to their website.</p>



<p>Cover different areas of your business, including the storefront and variegated interior angles.</p>



<p>Make sure important details like the hours of operation are up to date. Maximizing relevance will go a long way in improving the visitor-to-lead conversion rate.</p>



<p>We suggest browsing through our earlier blog titled “<a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/how-to-optimize-google-my-business-listing-and-leverage-it-for-more-sales/">How to Optimize Google My Business Listing and Leverage It for More Sales</a>” for more insights.</p>



<h3>3. Master the Art of On-Page SEO to Rank Locally on Google</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1653" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Neglecting on-page SEO is one of the most common mistakes that land small-scale local businesses in hot water.</p>



<p>Google uses over <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">200</a> unique factors in their algorithm to rank websites. Creating a strong <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/8-ways-to-adjust-your-seo-strategy-amid-the-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic/">on-page SEO strategy</a> can easily help you check most of these off your list!</p>



<p>For example, most small business owners don’t know that they can increase their chances of appearing in Google 3-Pack by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/05/14/speed-matters-how-your-websites-page-speed-can-affect-your-marketing-efforts/#7cc9f7bc1cbc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">improving their website’s loading time.</a></p>



<p>According to a recent study, pages that load quickly rank <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">significantly higher</a> on SERPs. In fact, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">79%</a> of customers who have trouble with a website’s loading time admit that they won’t return to the site in the future.</p>



<p>Here are some easy strategies to help speed up your website:</p>



<ul>
<li>Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML</li>
<li>Minimize HTTP requests</li>
<li>Reduce server response time</li>
<li>Opt for the right host (shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated server)</li>
<li>Enable browser caching</li>
<li>Compress images and optimize files</li>
<li>Use a CDN (content delivery network)</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, optimize your content by using relevant keywords, title tags, meta description, headlines, header tags, short descriptive URLs, and alt text.</p>



<p>These strategies will go a long way in helping your business rank higher on Google Maps.</p>



<h3>4. Attract a Plethora of High-Quality, Positive Reviews for Your Business</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1654" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>While leveraging reviews may sound like one of the least actionable strategies to help your business show up on the Google 3-Pack, it’s surreptitiously one of the most effective.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, Google loves reviews.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because customers trust them and heavily rely on them!</p>



<p>If your business has a high number of positive reviews, you’ll earn a great ranking on Google My Business. This ranking, in turn, will help you climb up SERPs and earn a spot in the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p>Remember, Google is constantly vetting relevant businesses to find the most reputable options that help customers have a great experience.</p>



<p>If your business has a poor ranking of 2.6/5, for example, the chances are that you’ll get stuck in the back end of SERPs.</p>



<p>Turn that around by boosting your ranking and you’ll instantly maximize your chances of showing up in the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p>But how do you go about this?</p>



<p>By requesting reviews.</p>



<p>According to a recent survey, over <u><a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/learn/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">97%</a></u> of customers engage with online reviews for local businesses. While customers prioritize <em>reading</em> reviews, they also understand the importance of <em>offering</em> reviews.</p>



<p>Here are some ways you can earn quality reviews for your business:</p>



<ul>
<li>Send a courteous and engaging email to customers, requesting a review for products/services they recently used. Opting for a personalized approach will increase your chances of receiving a timely and positive review.</li>
<li>Create a “Review Us” page on your website. When customers interact with the link, they should be redirected to your Google Review URL. This is a great way to ensure the reviews increase your chances of taking a spot in Google’s 3-Pack.</li>
<li>Use a <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/genius-qr-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">QR code</a> creatively to redirect customers to your Google Review page. Click <a href="http://qrcode.kaywa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">here</a> to generate a QR code using a free tool.</li>
</ul>



<h3>5. Create Engaging, Unique, and Value-Added Local Content</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1658" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Creating <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/why-content-driven-seo-is-the-ultimate-digital-marketing-strategy-for-2020/">local content</a> and tweaking product/service pages by incorporating local keywords is a powerful way to rank locally on Google.</p>



<p>We suggest using <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwj4jIeLjPfpAhVY4O0KHfzGAkMYABAAGgJkZw&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESQeD2ATTCDwsi9a7HZ3WrhcMTxqXpTvZ9vJunG7hMQumlK3VOrvZ82FJ9EkDGSGMyMYYehtCcNuWFrCzXfd2VxHUH&amp;sig=AOD64_2DpKVa8oZTxeOwZCFOFuRj1R1fCQ&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5lf-KjPfpAhWJQkEAHTbzA38Q0Qx6BAgPEAE&amp;adurl=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">Google Keyword Planner</a> or getting in touch with SEO experts to identify and effectively use local keywords.</p>



<p>In addition, create content around local events, holidays, news, and trending topics to ensure you reach a wide local audience. Optimizing your content for local search will ultimately help your business rank higher and tap into diverse local demographics.</p>



<p>Of course, don’t lose sight of ensuring that the content is engaging, informative, and compelling. No matter how well your local SEO strategy may be, producing subpar content that doesn’t strike a chord with your target audience will take you back to square one.</p>



<p>Instead, fuse quality with local SEO to create and execute a winning content marketing strategy.</p>



<p>We suggest focusing on creating high-quality and optimized:</p>

</ul>



<h3>6. Claim External Review Sites</h3>



<p>Popular external review sites like Yelp, Foursquare, Tripadvisor, Trustpilot, and Yellowpages are vital sources of traffic for your business. Each review on an external review site signals to Google to boost SERP rankings for your business.</p>



<p>We recommend browsing through each platform’s specific review guidelines to ensure compliance.</p>



<p>Once the reviews start pouring in, you’ll notice an increase in audience engagement and retention. Consistent positive reviews will help your business climb SERPs and earn a spot on the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<h3>7. Earn Local Backlinks From Websites With High Domain Authority</h3>



<p>Link building is undeniably one of the most effective ways to get your business on the map.</p>



<p>Simply put, link building is the process of acquiring backlinks from third-party websites.</p>



<p>For instance, if a non-competitor in your industry links to your content or product/service pages, you earn a backlink.</p>



<p>Why is this important?</p>



<p>Earning a valuable backlink from a website with a <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/high-domain-authority/">high domain authority</a> is a surefire way to attract quality traffic. As their readers are redirected to your content, you’ll successfully manage to tap into a wide audience base.</p>



<p>While this means more revenue, it also means higher chances of breaking into the Google 3-Pack in the long run!</p>



<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/10-advanced-link-building-tips-and-tricks-to-boost-your-seo/">advanced link building tips and tricks</a> to help you get started!</p>



<h3>8. Create a Mobile-Friendly Website</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1659" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-seo-stats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">78%</a> of all local mobile searches result in a purchase. As smartphones become the epicenter of the modern world, creating a mobile-friendly website is imperative.</p>



<p>If your website isn’t <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/responsive-mobile-design/">mobile-friendly</a>, you’ll fail to target the large majority of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X customers.</p>



<p>We suggest opting for clean yet appealing graphics, user-friendliness, and eye-catching CTAs (call-to-actions).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1660" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/14.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>In fact, mobile-friendliness also helps Google determine the quality and legitimacy of your business. If your website isn’t mobile-friendly, there’s no reason for Google to include it in the 3-Pack. The last thing Google wants is to receive negative feedback from customers who interacted with a business in the 3-Pack that didn’t have a mobile-friendly website.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1448" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/top-view-business-people-meeting_23-2148427084.jpg" alt="importance of Google My Business" width="626" height="414" /></p>
<p>While you may have developed an excellent marketing strategy with a strong focus on social media optimization and diverse marketing, overlooking the importance of optimizing your <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google My Business</a></strong> listing is a big faux pas that could cause your metrics to plummet.</p>
<p>So what exactly<em> is</em> Google My Business?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a free online tool for organizations and businesses to help them manage their online presence through Google, among Google properties such as Google Maps and Google Search.</p>
<p>Basically, it helps customers find your business and helps you tell them your business&#8217;s story. To make your listing more legitimate, you can even verify your Google My Business listing.</p>
<p>With over <u><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">90%</a></u> of Americans owning a cell phone, tapping into the depths of online directories has become one of the easiest ways to boost audience reach, engagement, and retention.</p>
<p>Let’s look at it this way:</p>
<p>Are you constantly on the lookout for new restaurants to try with your beau or family?</p>
<p>Do you jump at the thought of stumbling upon unique tech-savvy products that make your life easier?</p>
<p>Does the thought of coming across an affordable and trendy local online clothing store make you grin from ear to ear?</p>
<p>If you answered at least one of these questions in the affirmative, <em>Google My Business</em> has already impacted your life for the better.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever sought out a business that can help you meet your needs on Google, Google My Business has helped you find that business.</p>
<p>Like you, the majority of American consumers are actively seeking modern solutions to their needs—both consciously and subconsciously.</p>
<p>And let’s face it—nobody wants to crank open the yellow pages to find businesses that offer their desired products or services.</p>
<p>This is where Google My Business steps in.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1449" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1548345680-f5475ea5df84.jpg" alt="This is where Google My Business steps in" width="752" height="500" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1458" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-popular-business.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="250" /></p>
<p>By creating a profile laden with operating information and engaging text, photo, and video posts, businesses can give customers exactly what they’re looking for—and more.</p>
<p>With over <u><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nearly-all-consumers-97-now-use-online-media-to-shop-locally-according-to-biakelsey-and-constat-87221242.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">97%</a></u> of U.S. consumers using online platforms to shop locally, Google My Business is the most popular and effective online tool for businesses to leverage in 2020.</p>
<p>But how do you kick things off?</p>
<h2>Start by creating a Google My Business Account To Optimize For Greater Brand Visibility</h2>
<p>Each <strong>month</strong>, <u><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google</a></u> receives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 5 million searches for <strong>restaurants</strong></li>
<li>Approximately 3 billion searches for <strong>hotels</strong></li>
<li>1 billion searches for <strong>clothing shops</strong></li>
<li>Close to 600 million searches for <strong>cosmetic salons</strong> (hair, nails, makeup, skincare, and more)</li>
<li>5 million searches for <strong>coffee shops</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As the most popular, efficient, and easy-to-use search platform across the globe, Google offers businesses a plethora of opportunities to make their presence felt among consumers.</p>
<p>So give your brand visibility by getting on the map!</p>
<p>You can <strong>claim your business</strong> by <strong><u>creating a Google My Business listing</u></strong>.</p>
<p>We also recommend <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO9OelOoWWA&amp;vl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">linking your profile to your Google Ads account</a></strong> to <em>increase engagement on</em> your ads. Once you’re done, your profile will show up whenever users run local search queries.</p>
<p>A study conducted by Google revealed that <u><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/914/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search_research-studies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">50%</a></u> of users who searched for a local business on their smartphone visited the store within a day. As you optimize your Google My Business profile, your business will begin to climb SERPs, thereby helping you reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>Despite this incredible advantage, over <u><a href="https://www.lsainsider.com/study-56-of-local-retailers-havent-claimed-google-my-business-listing/archives#sthash.T9wEaibB.dpbs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">56%</a></u> of local retailers haven’t claimed their free Google My Business listing. If your business is part of this percentage, it may be time to give your brand the boost it deserves by creating an <strong>engaging, informative, and creative listing</strong>.</p>
<p>Include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone Number</li>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Business Hours</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Types of Payment Accepted</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Frequently Asked Questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only will an updated and relevant online listing help your business attract new customers, but it’ll also enhance credibility, reputability, and authenticity.</p>
<p>This will allow you to <strong>retain old customers</strong> and <strong>solidify your customer base</strong>, thereby boosting business metrics.</p>
<p>We also recommend applying for verification to utilize all the tools available on the GMB dashboard and enhance visibility across Google Search and Maps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1456" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ensure-NAP-Consistency.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="250" /></p>
<p>Increase local traffic by ensuring<em> NAP</em> (Name, Address, and Phone Number) consistency across your Google My Business profile, website, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>The<strong> consistency </strong>will add an air of professionalism to your business while helping users find accurate information across all digital platforms.</p>
<p>For instance, if your number is listed without area codes or prefixes (e.g., 1-800)on your website, it’s essential that your Google My Business page follows the same format.</p>
<p><strong><u>Listing accuracy also establishes trust</u></strong>, making customers feel more inclined toward completing a transaction with certain businesses. Imagine opening a brand’s Google My Business page, only to be confronted with inconsistent information, informal writing, and slipshod uppercase and lowercase usage.</p>
<p>The <em>informality</em> is very likely to put you off and compel you to browse further until you find a competitor that may not have an equally impressive range of products but offers a seamless and professional Google My Business profile.</p>
<p>While these details may seem negligible, they have a transformative—albeit subconscious—effect on the <u><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/281126" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">consumer buying process</a></u>.</p>
<h2>Make Your Listing Stand Out From the Crowd by Using Local SEO Services for Optimization</h2>
<p>Struggling to <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/getting-local-consumer-traction-by-ranking-up-on-google-maps-a-breakdown/">get more traffic from local visitors</a></u>? It may be time to optimize your Google My Business account by recruiting help from <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/local-seo-services.html">local SEO services</a></u>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1450" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/searching-engine-optimizing-seo-browsing-concept_53876-64993.jpg" alt="recruiting help from local SEO services" width="626" height="589" /></p>
<p>Digital marketing companies are equipped with years of expertise and the latest insights into organic Google My Business optimization, social media marketing, and lead generation. Not only will their cutting-edge marketing strategies help you climb SERPs, but you’ll also notice an improvement in key performance indicators.</p>
<h2>Request Customer Reviews and Actively Respond to Them</h2>
<p>Research indicates that over <u><a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">91%</a></u> of potential consumers read online reviews. Out of this, approximately <u><a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">84%</a></u> trust this information.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that customer reviews are a great way to <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/10-ways-to-build-a-strong-personal-reputation-for-individuals-and-entrepreneurs/">increase brand reputability</a></u> while doubling or tripling sales!</p>
<p>Leverage Google My Business by requesting reviews from your customers. You can do this by sending them a link via email or text. We also recommend actively responding to reviews—both positive and negative! Here’s how you could <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dangingiss/2018/08/27/4-simple-ways-to-respond-to-a-happy-customer-in-social-media/#23cbc66a3f5c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">express your gratitude</a></u> fora positive review:</p>
<p>Hi! Thank you for your feedback, [customer’s name]! We’re thrilled that you enjoyed our products/services. We look forward to delivering more quality products/services in the future and hope to see you again soon! It’s customers like you that keep us going. Hope you have a great day and continue to share your feedback with us in the future.</p>
<p>Not only will each customer feel individually appreciated, but they’ll also establish a virtual connection with the brand, thereby continuing to rely on their products/services. While you may feel compelled to leave negative reviews unanswered, responding to them in a diplomatic and reassuring manner is a great way to make things right.</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse of how you could go about it:</p>
<p>Hi, [customer’s name]! We’re so sorry our products/services didn’t meet your expectations. While our product/service is great for normal skin, it can irritate sensitive or eczematic skin. Our product/service is a great alternative that’ll recalibrate your skin’s pH while promoting a fresh and rejuvenating glow. If you’d like to return your product/service, please get in touch with our customer service team, and we’ll process a replacement or return right away! Keep us in the loop so we can suggest the best-suited products/services for your skin type and ensure you have a great experience this time around!</p>
<p>Tact? <strong><em>Check</em></strong>. Excellent customer service? <strong><em>Double check!</em></strong></p>
<p>Smart, empathetic, interactive, and remedial responses will <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanerskine/2018/12/31/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews-including-examples/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">undo the damage</a></u> while highlighting positive Google My Business reviews. This practice will create healthy engagement on your page while making customers feel heard and properly tended to.</p>
<p>We recommend maintaining professionalism and courteousness to ensure customer satisfaction instead of driving away potential customers. When done right, <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2019/11/06/customers-loyalty-small-business-responsive/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">healthy engagement</a></u> will increase local traffic and help consumers feel safe and assured about proceeding with a purchase.</p>
<h2>Make the Most of the Platform’s External Features</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1451" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1557426272-fc759fdf7a8d.jpg" alt="Leverage Google My Business" width="750" height="500" /></p>
<p>Leverage Google My Business to get your company on the radar by utilizing the platform’s external features. For instance, Google recently unveiled <u><a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/new-features-service-area-businesses-google-my-business/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new feature</a></u> for service area businesses.</p>
<p>By keeping an eye out for new developments, you’ll manage to boost metrics and increase local traffic.</p>
<p>In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in <u><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/9776543" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new announcement</a></u> that requests businesses to update their information—especially new hours of operations owing to the global quarantine.</p>
<p>This established the importance of visiting the <strong><a href="https://support.google.com/business/announcements/9244023?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official Google My Business update page</a></strong> for the latest developments so you can optimize your page while complying with the requirements.</p>
<h2>Create Engaging, Creative, and Compelling Posts That Leave a Lasting Impression</h2>
<p>Google My Business posts are easily <strong>one of the best ways to connect with your audience and increase sales</strong>. Post <em>engaging, creative, compelling, and original content </em>to <strong>captivate your audience</strong>. Not only will this help regular customers continue to return to your business, but it’ll also engage <strong>new customers</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, satisfied customers are very likely to <strong>indirectly promote your business</strong> to their friends and family through word of mouth. Whether you highlight a new clothing line with rich, high-quality images or showcase a recent launch or event with an engaging video, your page will garner more traction, thereby increasing local traffic and helping your business climb the SERP.</p>
<p>Google recently revealed that businesses with images receive <u><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6335804?hl=en#Share_photos" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">42%</a></u> more requests for directions to the outlet <em>and </em><u><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6335804?hl=en#Share_photos" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">35%</a></u> more clicks than brands with low-quality or no images.</p>
<p>We recommend uploading a <strong>captivating profile photo</strong> and <strong>cover photo</strong>. In addition, share powerful text, image, and video posts on a regular or semi-regular basis—including content that captures the storefront, interior aesthetic ambiance, products/services, and customers having a great time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1452" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/group-friends-eating-restaurant_23-2148006646.jpg" alt="captivating profile photo" width="626" height="417" /></p>
<p>Whether you showcase business colleagues diving into a delectable brunch or capture a middle-aged couple treating themselves to a relaxing couples massage at your luxurious spa, you’ll manage to engage audiences and increase clicks!</p>
<p>Don’t forget to ask for <strong>photographing consent </strong><em>before</em> you embark on your photography adventure, though.</p>
<p>Hire a professional photographer to ensure heartwarming and exuberant images that make customers feel excited about trying your products/services! You can also share GIFs and make the most of Google My Business’ call-to-action button.</p>
<p>Strike the perfect balance between engaging a range of audiences. We recommend focusing on <strong>millennials</strong> because of their <strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/09/us-generations-technology-use/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">unparalleled technology use</a></strong><strong> </strong>compared to other generations.</p>
<h2>Regularly Visit and Update Your Page</h2>
<p>Thinking of creating a Google My Business account, only to abandon it within a few weeks? You may want to rethink that.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to leverage Google My Business is being consistent and investing a little bit of hard work that’s bound to go a long way. In addition, leaving your page unattended could prevent you from getting back to negative reviews and strengthen your brand identity.</p>
<p>Review your listing on a frequent basis to update information, share engaging posts, respond to customer reviews, and answer FAQs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1453" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/interracial-team-working-together_23-2148349935.jpg" alt="respond to customer reviews" width="626" height="417" /></p>
<p>By <strong>answering pending questions</strong> and <strong>interacting with your audience</strong>, Google will process your <strong><u>listing as operational</u></strong>, thereby helping it show up in <strong>search results</strong>.</p>
<p>We also recommend posting on a frequent basis as Google My Business posts disappear after seven days. To ensure interactivity with new customers who may not have engaged with previous posts, produce fresh, timely, and hyper-specific content.</p>
<h2>Write an Engaging and SEO-Friendly Description</h2>
<p>This helps improve your Google My Business rankings.</p>
<p>Imagine coming across your favorite home furnishing store only to be let down by a bleak description that offers little to no information. While your eclectic bohemian rug may have sparked joy, a drab description could be enough to leave a sour taste in your mouth that may alter your buying habits.</p>
<p>Customers are always seeking fresh, engaging, and invigorating content that informs them without making them doze off.</p>
<p>To attract audiences while boosting metrics, we recommend writing a <strong>witty, informative</strong>, <strong>and SEO-friendly description.</strong> Keep things short and fun to prevent consumers from losing interest—which is very likely since Microsoft revealed that the average attention span has dropped from <u><a href="https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">12 to 8 seconds</a></u>.</p>
<p>Incorporate keywords that online searchers actively use. Not only will this increase local traffic, but it’ll also help customers find <em>exactly</em> what they’re looking for. If your description largely diverts from your products/services, it’s very likely that customers will feel frustrated upon encountering information that doesn’t meet their search requirements. Moreover, your listing may not even qualify for the top searches by virtue of its irrelevance.</p>
<p>Keep your description snappy, exciting, and SEO-friendly to ensure it shows up on Google Maps and helps customers find your location.</p>
<p>In short, your description should abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>No URLs/links</li>
<li>Focus on <strong>how your business stands out</strong> from the competition</li>
<li><strong>Avoid keyword stuffing</strong> at all costs</li>
<li>Avoid adopting a <em>heavily promotional</em> tone</li>
<li>Including a <strong>phone number/email address</strong> is acceptable</li>
<li>Win customers over with <strong>ingenuity, wit, humor</strong>, and a <strong>concise</strong> yet <strong>compelling description</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actively Track and Learn From Google My Business Insights and Google Analytics</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1454" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/high-angle-business-meeting-with-women_23-2148347229.jpg" alt="Learn From Google My Business Insights and Google Analytics" width="626" height="417" /></p>
<p>Use Google My Business insights and Google Analytics to track demographics and audience reach, engagement, and retention reports, among many others!</p>
<p>This information will help you fine-tune your SEO strategy and get more traffic from local visitors. In addition, the insights will serve as a powerful indicator of how you can boost your revenue, improve rankings, and generate more sales.</p>
<p>Closely track your customers’ conversion path for an understanding of their preferences to concurrently tweak your marketing strategy.</p>
<h2>Use the Platform to Actively Interact With Your Customers</h2>
<p><u><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/9114771?hl=en&amp;visit_id=637202206004724739-4067108650&amp;rd=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google My Business messaging</a></u> is a powerful tool that helps businesses interact with their customers and establish a strong connection that goes beyond review interactivity. Customers can easily ask you a question by clicking on the message icon on your listing.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s as easy as that!</p>
<p>Make the most of this feature by actively responding to queries, positive feedback, and constructive criticism. <strong>Google cleverly tracks average response time</strong> to help customers determine your response rate in advance.</p>
<p>Add a <strong>welcome message</strong> prior to engaging in the conversation to prevent leaving customers in a state of limbo. As an excellent way of promoting business transparency and boosting reputability, this feature will help your brand gain greater recognition and make its way to the top of search results!</p>
<p>You can also use posts to your advantage in order to promote events, offers, discounts, and content. You can essentially have this new information appear on Google Maps and Google Search within your <strong>business knowledge panel</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="#_Toc51076810">Parting Thoughts</a></p>
<p>If your local business website was affected by the recent core algorithm Google update, you weren’t the only one. Those who primarily work in the small business market should be particularly vigilant of how the update changed the dynamics of local search.</p>
<p><span id="more-987"></span></p>
<p>Google, the leading search engine company that rolled out the update, called the core algorithm update a global one which affected search results irrespective of region or language. There are claims on the internet of it targeting medical sites and YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) sites and local businesses that focus on Local SEO for their regional presence and visibility.</p>
<p>Google releases more than one update on a daily basis. This post will discuss the impact of the August 2018 Google update on local businesses.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51076804"></a>Local SEO Basics: What Is Local SEO?</h2>
<p>But first, let’s quickly bring everyone up-to-speed.</p>
<p>Local SEO is a great way to market your products or services to local customers who are actively searching for you based on region, zip code, or county. Many strategies can be employed to effectively use local SEO.</p>
<p>These include getting your website ranked on business directories like Yelp, creating localized web content, receiving positive online reviews, and more. However, the strategy that trumps them all is getting a website ranked on search engines like Google.</p>
<p>Professional local <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/seo-services/">SEO services</a> provide targeted online marketing which is far more effective than traditional means like printing an ad in a local newspaper. This is because while potential customers might or might not see the newspaper ad, they are instantly directed to your site if your business is located close-by.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how local and small businesses were affected post the Google update.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51076805"></a>Businesses in the Healthcare Industry Faced Losses in Organic Traffic</h2>
<p>A very clear casualty of the recent update was healthcare. A significant drop in organic traffic was observed for websites belonging to the healthcare industry. For example, those drug rehab sites which faced losses in customer traffic suffered because their web pages were related to certain medical malpractice lawsuits.</p>
<p>Previous core updates were referenced by Google as it claimed that there’s no fix for sites with consistently poor performance. They should focus on creating top-performing content to see a positive change in their rankings over time.</p>
<p>It maintains that with every update, there are some sites that benefit more than others. Notable drops and gains is part of the game. Pages that might not have been performing well gain rankings due to the changes in their systems.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51076806"></a>Keyword Rankings Increased</h2>
<p>It was observed that the latest Google update increased the rankings of the majority of keywords targeting different regions even though the primary address of that business was somewhere else nearby.</p>
<p>To elaborate, suppose a company is based in Dallas, Texas but gets most of their customer from Plano. The latest Google update increased the rankings of the majority of keywords involving Plano despite the fact that the company’s location is in Dallas.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51076807"></a>Changes in Organic Results</h2>
<p>Although it’s common to see algorithm updates impacting local or organic results, we noticed that the update affected both.</p>
<p>The time gap between the two updates was also kept short. The local update apparently occurred over the July 31-August 1 period. The organic update took effect the same day, from August 1-August 2.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51076808"></a>Backlinks Weren’t Affected</h2>
<p>There is a strong correlation with good quality content and hyperlinks. We don’t just mean the number of links, but the actual domain authority and website credibility.</p>
<p>The Google update focused more on web content quality than on hyperlinks.</p>
<p>This means that pages with appropriate backlinks ranked well on Google SERPs.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51076809"></a>Increased Gap Between Local and Organic Algorithms</h2>
<p>Typically, websites that rank high organically and the local results listings which rank high are directly related. However, this Google update hasn’t resulted in a correlation between the two at all.</p>
<p>This means that sites enjoying organic traffic boost didn’t experience high rankings in local results and vice versa. In other cases, the patterns are completely reversed. Websites with high organic results experienced a drop in local rankings and vice versa.</p>
<p>This means that the organic traffic of some websites decreased consistently and yet their local rankings increased significantly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Certain local SEO misconceptions refuse to budge. No matter what you do, these absurd myths keep cropping up.</p>
<p>Local SEO is in huge demand and for good reason. It’s easier to rank for regional keywords and more worthwhile and lucrative for businesses who are targeting a specific region or county based on their own physical location. The immense interest in the topic, unfortunately, leaves the door open for misconceptions to form and circulate. These range from assigning false importance to certain information to the role Google My Business support staff plays in local SEO rankings.</p>
<p>Although we’re not sure why these myths keep making a comeback time and again, we <em>do</em> know that it’s important for online businesses—of any organizational size—to learn the reality of local SEO.</p>
<p>In this post, we discuss the top 4 local SEO myths and explain exactly why they simply Will. Not. Work.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth #1—A Unique NAP Listing Will Influence The Ranking Factor</strong></h3>
<p>NAP is short for name, address, phone number.</p>
<p>There is a myth that the suite number of your office address mentioned in the Contact web page is going to make a difference in your website’s ranking because Google values it heavily in the search rankings.</p>
<p>Somehow they are convinced that this will make their office address gain more online visibility. So they include the suite number in their office address in the hopes of standing out from the competition.</p>
<p>Google uses suite numbers as nothing more than a visual aid. In fact, it often completely ignores suite numbers in addresses.</p>
<p>This means that if you’re adding suite numbers so that customers will have an easier time finding your location, that’s great. However, if you’re doing it for a ranking boost, you’re just wasting your time.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth #2—Your Ranking Is Penalized If You Don’t Follow Every Google Guideline</strong></h3>
<p>There are one of two things that can happen if you fail to follow a Google My Business guideline.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A) You get a soft suspension</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B) You get a hard suspension</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft suspension:</strong> This means that you cannot use Google My Business to manage your local business. This creates a huge issue as you are no longer able to respond to customer reviews, use Google Posts, or receive any notifications regarding your listing.</li>
<li><strong>Hard suspension:</strong> This has a more severe impact on your business as Google effectively eradicates your <em>entire </em>local business from its listing. This includes reviews, images, maps, and more. Since the listing has been taken down completely, there’s no way for your online business to rank in <em>any</em> of the local search pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, what Google doesn’t do is use an algorithmic method to diminish the ranking of your business listing. Doing so would violate their own guidelines.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth #3—Your Ranking Is Impacted By Your Service Area</strong></h3>
<p>Business owners can display a visual indicator of the distance they will travel to service their customers. They do this by adding their service area for listings in the Google My Business dashboard.</p>
<p>They believe that doing so influences their Google rankings.</p>
<p>It does not.</p>
<p>Even if you service 10+ cities, there will be no effect on your search engine ranking for those particular cities. The main factor which determines local rankings is which city your business is based in. This information is given in the address location on your web page.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth#4—Google My Business’s Support Team Can Fix Ranking Issues</strong></h3>
<p>There is an extensive support team at Google My Business. They interact with clients on popular social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter as well as via email, phone, chat, and their online forum.</p>
<p>Since it’s incredibly easy to access their service, companies usually get in touch with them when they face an issue involving Google My Business features.</p>
<p>When we say issues with features, we mean features and <em>not</em> ranking problems. Keep in mind that the on-call support staff at Google My Business isn’t comprised of SEO experts. This means that they have very limited technical knowledge of the way that the algorithm works.</p>
<p>The team of people is not engineering staff who deal with the algorithm, but only the platform experts. There’s no use reaching out to them to help you resolve local SEO ranking issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The SEO game is considered quite technical.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, but SEO success is mostly about getting the basics right. This is especially true for small business websites. And we’re sure plenty of high profile SEO gurus will <a href="https://moz.com/search-ranking-factors/contributors">agree</a> with us on that.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the Pareto Principle?</p>
<p>Here’s what it <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/03/07/80-20-rule/#7deca1893814">says</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8220;…80% of the results come from 20% of the action.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>Talk about perfectly timed coincidences.</p>
<p>Today, all we see on the surface is the glitz and glamor of advanced SEO techniques, and all we aggressively pursue. So many ignore the fact that <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/small-business-seo.html">small business SEO</a> success is still built on a strong foundation of the basics. We seem to have forgotten that basics are still the keys to being successful with SEO, and they play a HUGE role.</p>
<p>Here’s a very popular case study.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, Yoast SEO experts <a href="https://yoast.com/page-titles-seo/">experimented</a> with a series of optimizations to help improve traffic to their website; including keyword optimization.</p>
<p>They incorporated keywords into their catchy headlines.</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>This very simple improvement gave their website a traffic boost of almost 30%. That’s right! A whopping 30% boost.</p>
<p>So it’s clear that if you want SEO success for small businesses, you should start with the basics first! Build a strong SEO foundation. Hold tight to the Pareto Principle. Work on the 20-percent, and you’ll reach the 80-percent in no time.</p>
<p>What type of basics, you ask?</p>
<h2><strong>Start with the keywords and headlines</strong></h2>
<p>Since we’ve already discussed how SEO experts at Yoast used keyword optimization to accomplish SEO success, we think it will be perfect to use the strategy as a starting step.</p>
<p>The very first thing you need to do is find keywords that are relevant to your business and customer-niche. At the same time, these keywords should have low competition and a high search volume.</p>
<p>You can use a keyword research tool to help you out with this. Our personal favorites are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_pk/home/tools/keyword-planner/">Google Ads keywords tool</a></li>
<li><a href="https://moz.com/explorer/">Moz’s Keyword Explorer </a></li>
</ul>
<p>Come up with multiple keywords.</p>
<p>Once you have the right keywords, craft keyword-incorporated creative headlines for your webpages. Make sure the headings are not more than 60-characters long.</p>
<p>Try to place the keywords at the beginning of the headlines.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer">CoSchedule’s headline analyzer</a> to craft catchy headlines for your webpages.</p>
<p>While you’re at it, also optimize the URL of your webpages to include the keywords.</p>
<h2><strong>Move to a search-engine-friendly CMS</strong></h2>
<p>This is arguably the most fundamental mantra in small business SEO success.</p>
<p>Without a search-engine-friendly content management system, you simply can’t go anywhere; all your other SEO success strategies are ineffective.</p>
<p>Clay Cazier explains it really well in his <a href="https://searchengineland.com/seo-requirements-new-website-platform-254237">post</a> on Search Engine Land about what makes a CMS search engine friendly. You should definitely read it in your free time.</p>
<p>Our personal recommendation will be to use WordPress.</p>
<p>Here, at Search Berg, we’ve <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/web-design-development-services.html">designed and redesigned</a> many websites for our clients on WordPress, and we can safely say it’s one of the best search engine friendly CMS.</p>
<h2><strong>Optimize internal and outbound links</strong></h2>
<p>Internal links serve as gateways between your web pages. Outbound links on the other hand are reference links directing to webpages outside your website.</p>
<p>Quite often (and to our surprise), we see lack of internal linking on websites. For some reason, small business owners don’t use this practice as extensively as they use other practices.</p>
<p>Neil Patel gives a <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/commandments-of-internal-linking/">detailed argument</a> of how internal linking helps SEO.</p>
<p>Don’t let internal linking slip from your SEO net.</p>
<p>Internal linking helps your website visitors easily navigate your website. Plus, it generates valuable leads for your business.</p>
<p>As for your outbound links, run a check to make sure they are functional (not broken) and directing to credible, high authority websites. There are many tools available online that can help you assess the quality of your outbound links. This is important, considering how Google considers outbound links so significant.</p>
<h2><strong>Don’t forget the site structure</strong></h2>
<p>Your site structure is crucial to helping Google understand what your site and business is all about.</p>
<p>Google uses the structure of your website to guide its indexing process. If the structure is too complex or disorganized, Google might not be able to index it the way you want it to. This is certainly not good for your website’s rankings, and thus your business.</p>
<p>Make sure the content on your website is properly organized, with a clear hierarchy and easy to crawl structure.</p>
<p>Maintain a uniform hierarchy through all your webpages.</p>
<h2><strong>Work towards increasing your website speed</strong></h2>
<p>Website speed has been used as a <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">ranking factor</a> by Google since 2010.</p>
<p>And it’s not going anywhere, anytime soon.</p>
<p>Why Google places such high importance to website speed?</p>
<p>Because Google believes (and rightly so) that website speed directly influences online experience.</p>
<p>Fast websites improve a user’s online experience, while slow websites make it infuriating.</p>
<p>Consequently, websites with slower uploading speeds have high bounce rates. In turn, they’re ranked lower.</p>
<p>For small business SEO success, it’s critical to have a fast website.</p>
<p>To identify if your website is fast or slow, you can use a tool like <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a>.</p>
<p>If you notice that your website’s speed is slow, there’s a range of things you can do to fix speed issues:</p>
<p>There are multiple strategies you can pursue, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimizing your website’s design and code</li>
<li>Compressing the size of your CSS, JavaScript and HTML files</li>
<li>Investing in a CDN network</li>
<li>Changing your hosting service provider</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Enlist your business on Google My Business</strong></h2>
<p>This is a local SEO-specific strategy.</p>
<p>Google My Business is basically Google’s business directory.</p>
<p>By enlisting your business on Google My Business, you provide your business information to Google and the search engine then uses it to improve your business’s visibility during local searches.</p>
<p>It’s quite easy and straightforward to sign up for the service.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, it’s a very powerful platform for small businesses and you must use it.</p>
<p>And that’s pretty much it!</p>
