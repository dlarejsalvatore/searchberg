<p><strong> </strong></p>



<p>With 4<sup>th</sup> of July right around the corner, most of us can’t contain our excitement. The thought of red, white, and blue décor, a serene poolside BBQ party at home, and weekend-long festivities is enough to make even the most lackadaisical person feel re-energized.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to have a fun and memorable 4<sup>th</sup> of July weekend with your family, we’re right there with you!</p>
<p>Before you get started on those weekend plans, though, take a step back and ask yourself whether your business is equally geared up for the 4<sup>th</sup> of July festivities.</p>
<p>Sounds odd, doesn’t it? How can your business benefit from the upcoming holiday?</p>
<p>According to research, the average American spends a whopping <a href="../../../topics/holiday-and-seasonal-trends/independence-day.html" rel="”nofollow”">$76 on 4th of July food</a>, beverages, and supplies. This figure can easily add up to over $300 for a family of four.</p>
<p>And that’s not all. Over the years, 4<sup>th</sup> of July sales have become one of the most anticipated events of the year. From established brands to small businesses, marketers devise compelling and lucrative Independence Day sales that not only boost revenue, but also increase brand visibility on search engines.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to get started, we’ve rounded up some of the most effective and whip-smart 4<sup>th</sup> of July marketing strategies to <a href="../../../seo-service/small-business-seo/index.htm">help your small business</a> get a much-needed boost this weekend!</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc52790630"></a>Create Winning 4<sup>th</sup> of July Content</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1681" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/07/an-individual-creating-content-on-their-laptop-in-a-home-office.png" alt="an individual creating content on their laptop in a home office"></figure>
</div>



<p>If you’re <a href="../../6-digital-marketing-tips-for-small-businesses-struggling-to-navigate-covid-19/index.htm">new to the world of digital marketing</a>, you’ll probably hear the phrase “content is king” more than just a few times. But we’re here to make some changes: “content is king on a regular day and an <em>undefeatable emperor</em> on national holidays.”</p>
<p>Whether you write a value-additive, <a href="../../../blog-writing-services/index.htm">engaging blog</a>, post a visually <a href="../../../infographic-design-services/index.htm">dynamic infographic</a>, or win your audience over with a high-quality 4<sup>th</sup> of July video, you’ll notice a boost in traffic that’s unlike what you see on regular days.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there’s a spike in <a href="../../../seo-keyword-research/index.htm">search volume for certain keywords</a> during national holidays. And when it’s a holiday as hotly anticipated as the 4<sup>th</sup> of July weekend, you’ve struck gold.</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse of the search volume for the keyword <em>“fourth of July”</em> over the past thirty days in America (as retrieved from <a href="../../../trends/index.htm" rel="”nofollow”">Google Trends</a>):</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1682" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Google-Trends.png" alt="Google Trends"></figure>
</div>



<p>Notice the increase in interest over time?</p>
<p>As a small business, it’s essential for you to <a href="../../../sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2019/10/03/finding-the-hottest-keywords-for-your-business-15-effective-strategies/index.htm#333683624ff8" rel="”nofollow”">leverage popular keywords</a> and create content accordingly.</p>
<p>For instance, if you own a small beauty store in Miami, you could create a blog post <em>titled “5 Swoon-Worthy Fourth of July Makeup Looks for Miami Beauties.” </em></p>
<p>Get the gist?</p>
<p>You can recommend your products/services in different sections of the blog, especially the <a href="../../../sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/index.htm#52c7892a801b" rel="”nofollow”">CTA (call-to-action)</a>, to prompt a transaction. With many people searching for similar content, you’ll attract <u>a lot</u> of quality traffic.</p>
<p>The incorporation of a local keyword (<em>“Miami”</em>) will further help you <a href="../../../local-seo-services/index.htm">generate local leads</a> that are more likely to invest in your products/services.</p>
<p>Here are some great examples of blogs by businesses that have leveraged the same strategy to attract quality traffic and boost sales during the 4<sup>th</sup> of July holiday:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="../../../what-to-wear-on-the-fourth-of-july/index.htm" rel="”nofollow”">Fourth of July Fashion You’ll Actually *Want* to Wear</a></em> by <a href="../../../index-128.htm" rel="”nofollow”">Brit+Co</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Consult SEO keyword research specialists to find the right short-tail, long-tail, geo-targeting, and LSI keywords for your content.</p>
<p>We also suggest experimenting with <a href="../../../content-marketing/index.htm">different types of content</a>—including blogs, articles, guest posts, infographics, and videos—to dominate search engines for industry-specific 4<sup>th</sup> of July keywords this weekend!</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc52790631"></a>You Can’t Go Wrong With a 4<sup>th</sup> of July Sale</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1683" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/a-post-it-with-the-word-‘sale’-written.png" alt="a post-it with the word ‘sale’ written"></figure>

<p>There’s a reason why businesses across the U.S. launch winning 4<sup>th</sup> of July sales: they work, and they work <em>well</em>!</p>
<p>If you think it’s too late, you may want to think again.</p>
<p>Launching a 4<sup>th</sup> of July sale 2–3 days prior to the holiday is a great way to create a sense of urgency, which is more likely to result in great sales. In fact, 24-hour sales on national holidays have proven to be extremely successful over the years.</p>
<p>With many states releasing stay-at-home orders, it’s unlikely that your sale will go unnoticed.</p>
<p>We suggest using social media platforms (especially Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) to <a href="../../../social-media-management/index.htm">promote your sale</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some great examples to help you get inspired:</p>

<p>Using the right keywords by <a href="../../how-to-unleash-the-power-of-instagram-to-promote-your-brand/index.htm">opting for popular hashtags</a> will help your post gain more visibility.</p>
<p>And that’s not all. You can gain even more traction by <a href="../../../email-marketing/index.htm">emailing your customers</a> and informing them about the upcoming sale. If you have a specific list of loyal customers, reach out to them with personalized messages and product/service recommendations based on their shopping history.</p>
<p>A personal touch will go a long way in ensuring your sale is successful!</p>
<p>In addition, we recommend creating an <a href="../../../landing-page-design/index.htm">eye-catching, modern, and engaging landing page</a> for your upcoming 4<sup>th</sup> of July sale. While you may have covered all bases, an off-putting and bleak landing page could easily turn potential customers away from your website.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thecompanystore.com/" rel="”nofollow”">The Company Store’s</a> vibrant and gripping sales page is the perfect way to go about things:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thecompanystore.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2229 size-large" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog-1024x611.png" alt="The-Company-Store-sales-page" width="1024" height="611"></a></p>



<p>Ensure the page has a <a href="../../../website-speed-optimization/index.htm">fast loading time</a> to reduce bounce rates and customer attrition (loss of customers).</p>
<p>According to research, <a href="../../loading-time/index.htm" rel="”nofollow”">47% of visitors</a> expect a webpage to load in 2 seconds or less. In fact, if a webpage takes more than 3 seconds to load, an astounding <a href="../../loading-time/index.htm" rel="”nofollow”">40% of visitors</a> abandon the website.</p>
<p>While focusing on <a href="../../../web-design-development-services/index.htm">web design</a> is important, ensuring your website runs seamlessly is equally essential.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help you optimize the page and maximize conversions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the CTA straightforward and clickable</li>
<li>Ensure <a href="../../../responsive-web-design/index.htm">mobile-friendliness</a></li>
<li>Use the right keywords, title tag, meta description tag, header tags, and alt text</li>
<li>Use an exit popup</li>
<li>Include testimonials towards the end of the page</li>
<li>Link relevant 4<sup>th</sup> of July content (blogs, articles, infographics, etc.) on the page</li>

<h3><a name="_Toc52790632"></a>Use Your Platform to Shed Light on Juneteenth</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2230" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/07/blog1-4.jpg" alt="posters-racial-equity-and-justice-Black-Lives-Matter-protest" width="751" height="501"></p>
<p>While the 4<sup>th</sup> of July commemorates the Declaration of Independence, it’s important to note that this holiday doesn’t resonate with all Black Americans.</p>
<p>The Emancipation Proclamation did not bring about an end to slavery. In fact, slavery was abolished much later on the 19<sup>th</sup> of June, 1865—also known as <a href="../../../article/juneteenth-day-celebration.html">Juneteenth</a>.</p>
<p>Use your platform to shed light on Juneteenth and stand in solidarity with Black Americans who don’t celebrate the 4<sup>th</sup> of July. Acknowledge the racial inequity rooted in the holiday to truly empathize with and lend your support to the Black community. As an ally, use this opportunity to amplify Black voices, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the nationwide fight for racial equity and justice.</p>
<p>Currently, the United States Congress does not recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday. To play your part, we suggest launching a sale on Juneteenth next year and fervently celebrating the holiday.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="../../../en-us/2020/06/9849096/find-black-owned-businesses-online-apps.html">connect with small Black-owned businesses</a> in your industry and area. Of course, make sure they aren’t direct competitors. For instance, if you run a local salon, connect with small Black-owned businesses that sell beauty products that you could stock in your salon.</p>
<p>Look into investing in organizations that focus on reparations for slavery by reducing racial health disparities, among other interventions. <a href="../../../index-133.htm">Ben &amp; Jerry’s</a> powerful resources on <a href="../../../whats-new/2019/06/juneteenth.html">Juneteenth</a> and calls for racial justice are great examples of how you could tweak your marketing strategy accordingly.</p>

<p>Use the 4<sup>th</sup> of July to familiarize yourself with the nuances of racial injustice so we can collectively move toward freedom for the Black community, which is freedom for all.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc52790633"></a>Launch and Market 4<sup>th</sup> of July-Themed Products/Services</h3>
<p>Struggling to come up with innovative ideas? Depending on your industry, you can launch and market 4<sup>th</sup> of July-themed products/services to truly <em>wow</em> your audience.</p>
<p>Over the years, many brands have thought outside the box and devised creative ways to tweak their products/services to fit the classic 4<sup>th</sup> of July theme. <a href="../../../p/BkxkIqPBX42/index.htm">Hollister’s red and blue clothing line</a>, <a href="../../../p/BkvEYhthdU2/index.htm">Ralph Lauren’s customized cardigans</a>, <a href="../../../p/Bk0JitCgdKK/index.htm">BMW’s red and blue car exteriors</a>, and <a href="../../../p/BWINiL3APlf/index.htm">Lush Cosmetics’ <em>“American Cream”</em> conditioner</a> are the embodiment of 4<sup>th</sup> of July-themed personalization done right!</p>
<p>But it doesn’t end there.</p>
<p>Without doing marketing justice, you can’t expect your products/services to disappear off the shelves in time.</p>
<p>Create compelling social media posts and write engaging content to promote your collection. If you run a local business, use local SEO strategies to help time-sensitive content and campaigns hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Use <a href="../../../gmb-optimization/index.htm">Google My Business</a> and leverage popular online business directories to spread the word!

<p>Can’t do much? If you’re reading this post and thinking <em>“there’s no way I can implement these strategies this year,”</em> this may be the one for you.</p>
<p>If your schedule can’t allow anything that requires too much brainstorming or time, turn to <a href="../../../guest-blogging-services/index.htm">guest blogging</a>.</p>
<p>A guest blog is written by the host (your content team) and published on third-party websites within the same industry.</p>
<p>How does this help? If the website has a <a href="../../../high-domain-authority/index.htm">high domain authority</a> (great ranking on SERPs), you’ll receive an influx of high-quality traffic. As readers engage with the post and check out your website, they’re more likely to engage with your content and products/services.</p>
<p>We’re sure you’ve put two and two together! Not only will you attract quality traffic, but you’ll also get a much-needed boost in sales.</p>
<p>As one of the most effective <a href="../../10-advanced-link-building-tips-and-tricks-to-boost-your-seo/index.htm">link building strategies</a>, guest blogs help small businesses <a href="../../5-benefits-of-guest-blogging-for-small-businesses-owners/index.htm">become more visible across search engines</a>. Over time, your website will climb SERPs. If done right, guest blogs can also boost your chances of breaking into the <a href="../../what-is-googles-local-3-pack-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-rank/index.htm">Google 3-Pack</a>.</p>

</div>



<p>According to research, long-form content generates <a href="../../../article/blogging-statistics-and-trends.html#:~:text=Blog%20Length%20Statistics,-The%20average%20word&amp;text=Longer%2C%20in%2Ddepth%2C%20long,of%202000%20or%20more%20words." rel="”nofollow”">10 times more leads</a> than short-form content. In fact, it also receives more social media engagement.</p>
<p>Depending on your industry, pick a relevant and gripping title that can help you increase conversions. For instance, if you sell modern lighting fixtures, opt for a guest blog title that fuses 4<sup>th</sup> of July with your products, e.g. <em>“5 Stunning Décor Ideas to Get Your Home Ready for Fourth of July.”</em> Check the guest website’s domain authority by using the <a href="../../../website-authority-checker.html" rel="”nofollow”">AHREFS website authority checker</a>. The higher the score, the more credible and established the website!</p>
<p>Once you’ve found the right domain, run your content plan by them and wait for their approval. All systems go? Create and send your guest blog! Once it’s published, you’ll notice a gradual increase in high-quality traffic.</p>
<p>Leveraging the guest blogging strategy during national holidays is a great way to make the most of the organic increase in search volume.</p>
<p>As you <a href="../../../backlink-audit/index.htm">receive quality backlinks</a>, you’ll become an authoritative voice in the industry and help your business reach new milestones!</p>

<p>As the COVID-19 lockdown continues, small businesses <strong>across the globe</strong> have been struggling to keep up with <strong>key performance metrics</strong>, <strong>engage their audience</strong>, and <strong>retain customers</strong>.</p>
<p>While these businesses previously relied on <u>local offline marketing strategies</u> rather than internet marketing for long-term growth, the new wave of lockdown-induced <em>digitalization</em> has made it increasingly difficult to engage with customers without using technology.</p>
<p>According to Forbes, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../sites/briannegarrett/2020/03/20/small-business-relief-tracker-funding-grants-and-resources-for-business-owners-grappling-with-coronavirus/index.htm#12c74867dd4c" target="_blank">over 30 million</a> small businesses have suffered unprecedented customer attrition and revenue loss. With approximately <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../us-news/2020/apr/10/us-briefing-covid-19-second-wave-fears-as-deaths-rise-jobs-lost.html" target="_blank">6.6 million U.S. workers</a> losing their jobs each week, nationwide unemployment is rising at alarming rates.</p>
<p>The increasing use of social media and online browsing has necessitated the transition from offline marketing to strong online digital marketing that encompasses PPC marketing, social media marketing, content marketing, web design and development, and reputation management.</p>
<p>There is a dire need for innovation in marketing practices, especially for small businesses, and <strong><u>those who are innovating right now are indeed finding success</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Small businesses that <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../sites/bernardmarr/2020/03/20/why-companies-turn-to-digital-marketing-to-survive-covid-19/index.htm#5f88c2392425" target="_blank">leverage the best online marketing</a> tips and tricks during 2021 in this ongoing period of uncertainty witness <em>increases</em> in <strong>conversion rates</strong>, <strong>brand growth</strong>, and <strong>revenue</strong>.</p>
<p>To help you discover the realm of digital marketing and how you can immediately use it to benefit your small business, we’ve rounded up our <u>top eight Online and Digital Marketing tips</u>.</p>
<p>Using these, you can not only climb out of the COVID-19 abyss but have your business <strong>sustain </strong>and <strong>thrive </strong>both during and following lockdown.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Create an Engaging, Interactive, and User-Friendly Website</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1504" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo-1519222970733-f546218fa6d7.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500"></p>
<p>The ongoing pandemic has <strong>increased internet use</strong> by a whopping <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../sites/markbeech/2020/03/25/covid-19-pushes-up-internet-use-70-streaming-more-than-12-first-figures-reveal/index.htm" target="_blank">70%</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the surge in web browsing is expected to continue once the lockdown restrictions are eased.</p>
<p>Companies with a strong online presence have leveraged this boost in web traffic and have sustained revenues despite the nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>However, many small businesses have been apprehensive about transitioning from tried-and-trusted offline marketing strategies to web marketing.</p>
<p>While the change may seem challenging at first, you’ll<strong> immediately</strong> notice a boost in audience engagement and retention.</p>
<p>According to research, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../web-designers/resources/small-business-2017-website-survey.html" target="_blank">over 92%</a> of small business owners believe that having a user-friendly, engaging, and interactive website is the <strong>most powerful digital marketing strategy</strong> available to them.</p>
<p>The imperativeness of this has doubled over the past few months as the lockdown continues to boost web browsing.</p>
<p>Improve search rankings, local reach, and traffic by creating a comprehensive and fully-customized website. As more people gain easy access to your products and services, your business will expand organically.</p>
<p>Over time, you’ll manage to counteract the damage sustained during the initial months of the lockdown.</p>
<p>Now that you understand the importance of having a solidly engaging, interactive, and user-friendly website, you may be wondering how to go about accomplishing solid digital marketing for your small business&#8217; website.</p>
<p>Here are some best practices for you to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep your <strong>layout simple</strong>. Figure out what the absolute essentials of your website are and draw focus to that. This helps your website have a <em>&#8220;clean&#8221;</em> aesthetic that is also functional.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having a clean and functional approach also helps to reduce your load times and make it easier for users to navigate on multiple devices.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Speaking of multiple devices, make absolutely sure that your website is designed to <strong>work in a mobile and tablet format</strong> as well as the traditional desktop format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not only does this make life far easier for a customer who wants to check out your site on their phone/tablet, but it also improves your search rankings.</p>
<p>This is because recently, Google has had a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../2015/04/21/google-mobilegeddon/index.htm" target="_blank">Mobilegeddon</a> tweak to its search algorithm. Basically, if your website does not have a mobile-friendly interface, Google will punish your website by reducing your rankings.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t forget mobile device compatibility because it can make or break your site&#8217;s rankings.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make your site&#8217;s <strong>navigation features easy to follow</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a business, your goal is to have a customer <em>stay </em>on your website.</p>
<p>The way that they stay is by clicking around.</p>
<p>Therefore, since you want them to stay on your site for longer periods, you need to <strong>make the navigation easy</strong>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Make use of <strong>highlighted calls to action</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this effectively, you need to ask yourself what you want your customer to do when they are on your site. Do you want them to buy products, book a phone call, call your business&#8230;?</p>
<p>Figure out your calls to action and slap them on your site.</p>
<p>Highlight and design them in such a way that the user can&#8217;t miss them without being obnoxiously sales-y. Simple buttons work just fine for this.</p>
<p>In addition to your web pages and outside content, you can also use calls to action <strong>throughout your content</strong> when they become relevant.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Lastly, don&#8217;t underestimate the power of <strong>simple, good-looking, </strong>and<strong> easy-to-read font</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2. Leverage Social Media for Increased Customer Engagement and Retention</h2>
<p>With a sleek and interactive website, you should take advantage of social media to engage customers and send them to your site.</p>
<p>This is because, according to research, the ongoing lockdown has increased social media use by <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../news/people-are-spending-20-more-time-in-apps-during-the-covid-19-lockdowns-re/575403/index.htm" target="_blank">20%</a>.</p>
<p>As people transition to working and studying from home, there has been a <a href="../../8-reasons-to-protect-your-brands-online-reputation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/index.htm">15–40%</a> increase in popular social media applications like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.</p>
<p>While focusing on powerful web design and development is imperative, it’s equally important to <strong>leverage social media for increased customer engagement and retention</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you can do to establish a strong social media presence:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><u>Actively interact</u></strong> with customers. By doing so, you are building relationships with them. This is key because customers are <em>far more likely to <strong>purchase </strong>from a brand they have had a positive social media interaction with. </em></li>
</ol>
<p>Helpfulness, kindness, positivity, and a well-phrased joke can go a long way.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><u>Optimize your content stream</u></strong><u>.</u> What can help you immensely if you&#8217;ve already been doing <strong>social media for your business</strong> is to do an <strong>audit of your content</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use this audit to see what is working, gaining traction, performing well, starting conversations, and building relationships with your customers.</p>
<p>Based on this audit, <strong>do more of what works and less of what doesn&#8217;t work well</strong>. Tweak what doesn&#8217;t work and execute new ideas.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><u>Use rich images and videos</u></strong>. Especially during the pandemic, people&#8217;s online appetite for video has increased <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1107559/video-streaming-consumption-growth-worldwide-coronavirus/" target="_blank">immensely</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to break the bank to make videos and can very much do it yourself.</p>
<p>You can do so by making sure your video content is <u>in line with your business goals/objectives, keeping it short, writing a script, optimizing messaging, and paying attention to your videos&#8217; analytics.</u></p>
<p>We will delve deeper into video marketing later in this blog post.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><u>Check out your <strong>competitors</strong></u>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely frowned upon to copy strategies, but there&#8217;s nothing wrong with <em>looking through</em> your competitor&#8217;s posts to see what their strategy is and take inspiration from it.</p>
<p>It might spark some awesome content ideas for your own business and, in turn, help you drive engagement.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong><u>Set goals and key objectives</u></strong> for your social media efforts.</li>
</ol>
<p>A great framework for goal setting that is also applicable to goal setting outside of social media is the <strong>SMART framework</strong>.</p>
<p>In this, you define your goal by making it specific, measurable, achievable/realistic, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Take advantage of <strong><u>&#8220;social media listening.&#8221;</u></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose you run a bakery and you go to Twitter. If you look into conversations people are having about your bakery, you might come across some valuable feedback that you might have missed because the customers were saying it to <em>each other</em> as opposed to you directly.</p>
<p>This is <strong>social media listening.</strong></p>
<p>You now have the opportunity to take the feedback, explore if others feel similarly on social media, and make adjustments to your products (e.g., cake moisture levels) accordingly.</p>
<p>You can do this effectively by <strong><u>monitoring social media platforms actively for mentions of your products, brand, competitors, and even keywords relevant to your business</u></strong><u>.</u></p>
<p>The first step to good communication is to listen carefully.</p>
<p>Not only will this help you redirect customers to your website, but you’ll also notice an increase in direct orders for your products/services.</p>
<p>Also known as <strong><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../sites/propointgraphics/2016/08/07/what-is-social-selling-and-how-do-you-do-it/index.htm" target="_blank">social selling</a></strong>, social media selling helps small businesses boost revenue by doubling or even tripling online transactions. As your brand successfully taps into the digital realm, you’ll manage to generate more leads and expand your business.</p>
<h2>3. Develop an Empathetic and Crisis-Friendly Digital Marketing Approach</h2>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many brands have been called out for <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../5814509/coronavirus-marketing/index.htm" target="_blank">insensitive marketing campaigns</a>. As small businesses transition to the digital landscape, it’s essential to tread with care and avoid developing an <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../article/cmo-strategy/7-brands-ads-unfortunately-timed-coronavirus-pandemic/2244631.html" target="_blank">excessively promotional</a> marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Instead, develop an empathetic and crisis-friendly approach to ensure customers feel comforted, motivated, and inspired during a time of global chaos and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Starbucks’ <strong>thoughtful and empowering</strong> posts are a great example of putting your customers first instead of capitalizing on a global pandemic:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1505" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png" alt="" width="490" height="204"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1506" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.png" alt="" width="496" height="178"></p>
<p>Not only will empathetic messages help customers feel reassured, but they’ll also improve your brand reputation and identity. As you continue to engage with your audience in a supportive and encouraging manner, you’ll notice an increase in <strong>audience engagement, retention, and growth</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1512" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Pro-Tip-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="250"></p>
<p>Here are some great examples by Chick-fil-A and Starbucks:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1507" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3.png" alt="" width="628" height="366"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4.png" alt="" width="584" height="341"></p>
<p>While we recommend using digital platforms to share your products/services, take strict measures to avoid blurring the lines between blatant promotion and crisis-friendly branding.</p>
<p>Demarcating each category will help you avoid overstepping, thereby connecting with your customers <em>without</em> overselling or capitalizing on the ongoing crisis.</p>
<h2>4. Focus on Reputation Management</h2>
<p>While you may feel compelled to manage your web presence and social media accounts yourself, asking for help is crucial.</p>
<p>As small business owners adopt digital marketing strategies, they’re largely unfamiliar with the subtleties of managing a <a href="../../../business-reputation-management/index.htm">strong digital reputation</a>.</p>
<p>While increased web activity and social media use are extremely beneficial, it can also backfire in some instances.</p>
<p>Receiving negative feedback and false reviews is a common occurrence. However, leaving them unattended could harm your brand in the long run.</p>
<p>As potential customers interact with the negative content, they’re likely to change their minds and look for a competitor who offers similar products/services. In addition, you run the risk of losing unsatisfied customers by leaving their complaints unattended.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="../../8-reasons-to-protect-your-brands-online-reputation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/index.htm">reputation management experts</a> step in.</p>
<p>They help brands detect and respond to negative feedback in an empathetic, polite, and remedial manner. Moreover, business reputation monitoring and management agents also help remove the factually incorrect information, cyber-attacks, and intentional public vitriol that could cost your brand in the long run.</p>
<h2>5. Create Powerful Web Content</h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_1509" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1509" style="width: 626px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1509" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/website-design-content-layout-graphic_53876-13764.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="345"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1509" class="wp-caption-text">Website Design Content Layout Graphic</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You may have accomplished the feat of creating a visually dynamic, informative, and immersive website.</p>
<p>But this doesn&#8217;t mean that you now get to drop the metaphorical mic and let your social media run itself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to maintain this strong web presence (read: stay relevant) by continuing to share <strong>high-quality blogs, articles, press releases, infographics, and other promotional media </strong>because these methods <a href="../../5-reasons-why-you-need-power-blog-posts-for-your-website-blog/index.htm">maximize audience retention</a>.</p>
<p>As preexisting customers engage with your content, they’ll be redirected to your products/services, thereby minimizing customer attrition and ensuring long-term brand growth. Sharing promotional web content also helps attract new audiences.</p>
<p>We recommend developing a crisis-sensitive approach to ensure customers feel acknowledged instead of overwhelmed. Include a powerful yet empathetic CTA to redirect them to your product/service pages and/or social media accounts.</p>
<h2>6. Leverage Local SEO Strategies for Higher Rankings</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1215.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640"></p>
<p>Focusing on <a href="../../../local-seo-services/index.htm">local SEO</a> is a powerful way to target local audiences and receive higher rankings on SERPs. As people spend more time indoors, they’re actively seeking products/services that can be delivered to their doorstep.</p>
<p>As you optimize your website for local searches, you’ll successfully increase your local customer base.</p>
<p>Claim your free <a href="../../how-to-optimize-google-my-business-listing-and-leverage-it-for-more-sales/index.htm">Google My Business listing</a> to enhance visibility and relevance. We recommend updating the page and sharing posts to receive a higher ranking on Google. Maintain NAP (name, address, and phone number) consistency to improve credibility.</p>
<p>We also suggest optimizing web content—including web copy, blogs, articles, and press releases—based on region-specific keywords. This strategy will help your business climb SERPs and attract more customers.</p>
<p>Use title tags, meta description, header tags, and additional on-page SEO elements to give Google a clear idea of the regional availability of your products/services.</p>
<h2>7. Leverage Video Marketing</h2>
<p>As one of the <strong>most effective digital marketing tools</strong>, video marketing helps brands share their products/services with customers without losing their attention.</p>
<p>As the average human attention span drops to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/index.htm" target="_blank">8 seconds</a>, keeping audiences engaged has become more challenging than ever. While text and image-based content is powerful in its own right, video content has proven to be <em>more</em> impactful.</p>
<p>According to research, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../sites/miketempleman/2017/09/06/17-stats-about-video-marketing/index.htm#122e4308567f" target="_blank">90%</a> of customers admit that product/service videos play a big role in finalizing their buying decision. In addition, brands that use video content enjoy over <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../sites/miketempleman/2017/09/06/17-stats-about-video-marketing/index.htm#122e4308567f" target="_blank">41% more web traffic</a> than their competitors.</p>
<p>As video emerges at the forefront of marketing, creating engaging, entertaining, and empathetic video content has become more important than ever.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/smiling-young-man-filming-his-video-blog-episode_171337-5536.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="417"></p>
<p>Whether you create an explainer video that educates your audience about your products/services or a company culture video that briefly outlines your work-from-home adaptation strategy, video marketing will help build a <strong>strong customer base</strong>.</p>
<p>We recommend posting the video content on your website and social media pages for better reach.</p>
<h2>8. Keep Up With Your Competitors!</h2>
<p>Monitor successful local competitors’ websites to develop an idea of different strategies that you could potentially try in the future. While you may have utilized powerful digital marketing tactics, there’s always room for improvement.</p>
<p>We also recommend keeping up with industry trends to stay on top of the competition and sneak in some much-needed inspiration when needed.</p>
<p>Browse through your competitors’ social media pages to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="../../../sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2019/02/26/15-ways-to-keep-up-with-your-business-competition-even-on-a-budget/index.htm#293c606249ab" target="_blank">review their engagement</a> and customer response strategy. This will help you determine <em>lapses</em> in your <strong>audience engagement strategy</strong> and update tactics if needed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1513" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Pro-Tip-2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="250"></p>
<p>Now you have learned everything you need to: <strong>optimize your social media approach</strong> for engagement<strong>, </strong>update your<strong> brand voice for crisis time, </strong>creating<strong> important </strong>and<strong> powerful content </strong>that<strong> helps and resonates </strong>with your<strong> audience, </strong>performing <strong>basic SEO practices,</strong> and<strong> keeping on top of your competitive research.</strong></p>

<p>In today’s tech-focused world, virtually all aspects of our lives are intimately connected with the internet. Businesses, both small and large, rely on the internet to reach out to a worldwide audience and market their products/services. In short, digital marketing has become the new norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2103" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blog1.jpg" alt="concept illustration of the process of guest blogging for SEO" width="1000" height="684"></p>
<p>Creating online blogs is a marketing technique that is popular among many small and large businesses—and this isn’t surprising. It’s an effective and efficient way to establish yourself as an authority in your industry and draw attention to your offerings. In fact, a survey conducted by HubSpot revealed that blogging is the top content marketing priority for 53% of marketers.</p>
<p>But, just like any other type of blog, it can be quite tricky to maintain a small business blog. It takes a lot of effort and a significant amount of research to draw and capture the attention of today’s highly impatient online consumers.</p>
<p>In order to create a successful blog, you need to have a firm understanding of your target audience, develop a robust blogging schedule, create fresh content that interests readers, and design a visually engaging, user-friendly, and interactive website.</p>
<p>The question on many business owner&#8217;s minds is: does Guest Blogging improve or have benefits for SEO?</p>
<p>While building authority by creating and maintaining a blog is all well and good, a small business (or any sized business really) also requires the support of its peers to succeed—and this is where <u><a href="../../../guest-blogging-services/index.htm">guest blogging for SEO</a></u> comes in.</p>
<p>You see, it’s not difficult to find websites with big audiences that are willing to help you grow your small business. Collaborating with them by publishing quality guest posts on their platform exposes your businesses to a large audience, and ultimately drives traffic to your website.</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why guest blogging is the key that opens the doors to brand development, customer acquisition, and small business growth.</p>
<h2>Expand on Social Media</h2>
<p>You can also grow your brand presence on social media as a result of guest blogging.</p>
<p>This is one of the biggest pros of Guest Blogging for small businesses and bloggers.</p>
<p>Social media shares definitely follow a domino effect once the sharing ball gets rolling on your content.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are sending your guest post to a website that gets a fair amount of social media shares, it is likely that your post will get a lot of shares as well.</p>
<p>A hack to triple and even quadruple the number of shares you get through social media through a guest post and otherwise is to embed high-value sharable content within your blog.</p>
<p>This can look like a really helpful infographic.</p>
<p>The best kind of infographics are those that break down complex topics and content into easily digestible and understandable graphics or flow charts.</p>
<p>To get you started on your infographic, <a href="../../../sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/01/25/12-effective-ways-to-use-infographics-for-marketing/index.htm?sh=7ee681fb6da1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a> is an awesome guide to help you create yours today.</p>
<p>The great thing about guest posts is that your page will be linked back to and tagged.</p>
<p>Guest blogging can, in this way, increase not only the social media shares of your content but also increase your follower count and your lead generating efforts.</p>
<p>By getting your work published on a blog that has authority, you are essentially upping your own authority as well because they are referring you as a credible source to their audience.</p>
<p>When you get to create your contributing profile, in order to maximize click-throughs to your social media, make sure to link to your accounts in your bio section.</p>
<p>This way, specific readers who take the time to check out your author bio will actually be able to connect with you or your business via social media, making your posts a regular part of their newsfeeds.</p>
<p>Since you now have them on your social feeds, you want to remind them why they followed you.</p>
<p>The way you do this is by regularly posting high caliber, helpful content for them to digest. Not only does this engage the followers you garnered from the guest blog you posted, but it also helps your organic reach on social media.</p>
<p>Content truly is king, so don&#8217;t forget to keep providing value to stay at the forefront of your audience&#8217;s minds.</p>
<h2>Create Brand Awareness &amp; Enhance Online Exposure</h2>
<p>One of the most significant benefits of guest blogging for small business owners is increased online exposure and brand awareness.</p>
<p>Why do these matter?</p>
<p>Well, nobody will spend money on your business if they don’t know it exists, right?</p>
<p>Simply put, guest blogging gets your name out there and thus benefits your small business&#8217;s SEO.</p>
<p>Considering how intensely competitive the digital marketing environment is today, don’t you think it’s ideal to <u><a href="../../10-advanced-link-building-tips-and-tricks-to-boost-your-seo/index.htm">earn quality backlinks</a></u> and <u><a href="../../what-is-googles-local-3-pack-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-rank/index.htm">climb SERPs</a></u>?</p>
<p>Moreover, notable online marketing experts believe that it takes around 5 to 7 impressions before a consumer is able to remember your brand, which means that in order to make the greatest impact, it’s essential to write relevant guest blogs as frequently as possible.</p>
<p>But how exactly does guest blogging <u><a href="../../../sites/forbescoachescouncil/2019/10/02/13-budget-friendly-methods-for-increasing-brand-awareness/index.htm#6ec8d620320d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">create brand awareness</a></u> and increase exposure for your business? Well, let us explain through an example. Let’s assume that you have the opportunity to publish a guest blog on a site that has 100,000 followers, and 10,000 of them end up reading your blog. Even if the likelihood of getting redirected traffic from this post to your site is low, you still get the chance to introduce your businesses to thousands of potential consumers.</p>
<p>But how do you increase the chances of acquiring redirected traffic? Well, here’s what you need:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1358" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Targeted-Audience-and-Targeted-Keyword.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="250"></p>
<h2>Improve your niche-wide authority</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a formula for transforming your guest content efforts into leads for your business.</p>
<p>Good, helpful content + high authority site within your niche = greater authority within your niche = greater trust among potential customers.</p>
<p>This greater trust comforts the followers of your work to convert from prospects to paying customers/clients.</p>
<p>Guest blogging in this way helps your target audience see you as a credible, reliable source of information to help them solve their pain-points.</p>
<p>Therefore, because of this initial trust, they are more open to the value propositions that you present to them.</p>
<p>A hot lead that trusts your authority will always convert faster than a cold one.</p>
<h2>Increase your qualified leads</h2>
<p>A qualified lead is essentially a lead that is further down the sales process.</p>
<p>They have already expressed interest in your value proposition and therefore need less convincing to convert as opposed to someone who is simply browsing.</p>
<p>To get these qualified leads, the key is to find websites to guest post on that already have a regular and reliable flow of traffic as well as relevancy in your niche.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that you will be able to guest post with a direct competitor but try to find a high authority, a well-respected site within your niche as a whole to post on.</p>
<p>When you post your links within your blog, there is a certain art and finesse to making sure people want to click that big call-to-action button, which leads to your website.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it can very well be perceived as a useless waste of space that took up the reader&#8217;s time without a pay-off rather than the highly converting benefit of Guest Blogging that it can be.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this approach (or lack thereof) can result in very few click-throughs and leads from the guest post.</p>
<p>The key is to create unity between the CTA you post and the actual page that it leads to.</p>
<p>Make sure both of these are related to the overall content of the guest post you are writing.</p>
<p>This <strong>actionable step</strong> should read in the prospect&#8217;s mind as a <strong>reasonable next step from the guest blog</strong> they just read in order to solve their pain-point.</p>
<p>Use This Content Marketing Opportunity to Shorten Your Sales Cycle</p>
<p>The key here is that rather than waiting for potential customers to show up on your website, you get to help them discover your unique value proposition on a trusted third-party website.</p>
<p>In this way, you get to shorten your sales process for your services and products.</p>
<p>To capitalize on the match between your value proposition and the topic you write about, you need to be very strategic about what you blog about.</p>
<p>Think of yourself as a guest blogging ninja who is there to strike specific key pain-points that are relevant to the solutions you provide (i.e., your services and products).</p>
<h2>Educational Content</h2>
<p>Ensure that the content of your guest blog is <u><a href="../../../sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/08/23/how-educational-content-can-lead-to-more-business/index.htm#1db341d92617" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">engaging and educational</a></u>.</p>
<p>Discuss trends and insights to become an authoritative voice in the industry and increase your chances of persuading readers to visit your website.</p>
<p>The reason that educational content performs so well is that bridging people&#8217;s gaps in their knowledge helps them to solve problems and understand their pain-points better so that they can tackle them more effectively.</p>
<p>Good educational content provides value.</p>
<p>Engaging and good educational content provides value and builds engagement.</p>
<p>Try to be the professor that enthralls and inspires his or her class to change the way that they think to solve their problems.</p>
<p>The root of most problems is, after all, a mindset difference.</p>
<p>This is a key advantage of Guest Blogging for startups who are still building their name and can exponentially speed up the process.</p>
<p>Empowered with the right knowledge presented to them in the right way, people act differently, and for that mindset shift, a prospect will be grateful.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51075634"></a>Call to Action</h2>
<p>What’s the point of investing your precious time and resources to create quality content and not get even a single email in return? Make sure you insert a <u><a href="../../../sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/index.htm#3143b412801b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">call to action</a></u> in the conclusion of each blog post.</p>
<p>Deciding the specifics of the call to action is up to you—you can either ask the readers to sign up for your newsletter, or simply urge them to leave feedback in the comments section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2105" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blog3.jpg" alt="concept illustration of the process of creating brand awareness for local businesses" width="1000" height="699"></p>
<h2>Identify Potential Customers and Sales Opportunities</h2>
<p>We’ve already mentioned that guest blogging exposes your brand to new audiences, but how exactly does it help generate more leads?</p>
<p>Well, when you offer solutions to readers’ problems through your guest blogs, they start considering you to be an expert in your particular industry or niche.</p>
<p>They will follow you, approach you, and visit your website to gain more information.</p>
<p>Of course, this will expose your products or services to new consumers, and the ones that are interested in your products will make inquiries.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the higher the generated business leads, the higher the sales—and the higher the sales, the higher the profits.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51075636"></a>Expand Your Email List</h2>
<p>Emails have long established themselves as a reliable tool for business development and branding. The sheer power that enables you to reach the meticulously managed inbox can be life-altering. Utilize email marketing in an efficient manner and watch how fast your small business grows.</p>
<p>The biggest key to building your email list, which you can even discuss and link in your guest post, is to create an &#8220;opt-in incentive.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is some document, video, training, etc., that provides value to your prospective customer.</p>
<p>Some examples of this are a checklist, an ebook, an exclusive video or video series, etc. Whatever format you choose, the incentive you provide needs to be electrifying and value-adding enough that your prospect will want it to help them solve their problem.</p>
<p>In exchange for this amazing, value-adding piece of content you provide them with, your opt-in form will ask for their email address.</p>
<p>Once they&#8217;ve opted in, and your email marketing software has sent them their opt-in incentive, boom &#8211; you&#8217;ve got a new email subscriber, and your list is primed to grow in this way.</p>
<p>However, there’s one mistake that you should avoid at all costs: <em>spamming.</em></p>
<p>Developing an email list can be quite a tricky undertaking, especially if you’re new on the block. Not every visitor of your website shares their email address or signs up for a newsletter. However, guest blogging can just be the growth catalyst you need to start building an email list.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1357" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/collaborate-with-established-bloggers.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="250"></p>
<p>However, it’s essential to make your readers believe that being on your mailing list will provide them with access to valuable information.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, you need to work on the varied nuances of the blog post, and make sure that it’s the perfect blend of information, sales pitch, and call to action.</p>
<p>Another way of <u><a href="../../5-digit-email-lists/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">expanding your email list</a></u> is to ask established bloggers to share their email lists. However, it’s not as simple as it sounds. You need to offer them something in return for this favor. This could be an engaging infographic or a well-written blog post.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51075637"></a>Create an Environment of Engagement and External Feedback</h2>
<p>An important aspect of devising great digital marketing strategies involves developing unique new ideas or modifying plans to fit current requirements. Another great benefit of guest blogging for small businesses is access to community insights, which can help fine tune those strategies.</p>
<p>Just pull up a well-written blog post on a popular website with <u><a href="../../../high-domain-authority/index.htm">high domain authority</a></u>, and you’ll find the comment section filled with the readers’ opinions, experiences and ideas—and this is exactly what guest blogging gives you access to. It helps you to get <u><a href="../../../sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2020/01/24/10-ways-your-company-can-benefit-from-encouraging-criticism/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">constructive feedback</a></u> from areas outside your own website.</p>
<p>Put it this way: you come across a person who has constructive, insightful suggestions to a blog post from a website belonging to someone else. This feedback may inspire you to do something that ends up accumulating quality traffic.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2107" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Communication1.jpg" alt="concept illustration of branding efforts" width="937" height="986"></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51075638"></a>Broaden Your Online Publication Network</h2>
<p>When it comes to developing a brand, networking is one of the most important components. Just as the adage goes, “<em>It’s not all about what you know, but also who you know.</em>” This statement is as relevant in today’s business landscape as it was 50 years ago.</p>
<p>The key to successful networking is <u><a href="../../../sites/amyblankson/2019/08/15/why-collaboration-is-the-currency-of-the-future/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">collaborating with businesses</a></u> that are capable of helping you build a recognizable brand across their own network. It’s like creating a web of awareness where all the involved parties can potentially help each other. As a matter of fact, this is the underlying idea behind the LinkedIn social media hub.</p>
<p>Publishing guest blogs on other websites allows the creation of networks between website owners and readers alike. Furthermore, these networks often lead to collaborations, which take business relationships to new heights.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc51075639"></a>Use Guest Posting to Boost Your SEO</h2>
<p>Guest blogging is easily one of the most in-demand <u><a href="../../../content-marketing/index.htm">content marketing services</a></u> right now. Unsurprisingly, companies are increasing hiring guest blog writers to work on their website. An increasing number of entrepreneurs, businesses, and companies are maximizing the unique benefits of hiring expert guest bloggers, which include generating quality backlinks, boosting authority, improving name recognition, increasing the chances of getting featured on high-traffic platforms, and gaining the trust of a large target audience.</p>
<p>If you’ve been struggling to use guest posting to boost your SEO, we can help you kick things off.

<p>In today’s digitized world, entrepreneurs and small business owners can’t get away with not knowing SEO strategies. In fact, e-commerce and SEO tools have become fundamental aspects of online marketing.</p>
<p><u><a href="../../../fact-tank/2019/11/19/americans-favor-mobile-devices-over-desktops-and-laptops-for-getting-news/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Research suggests</a></u> that people prefer mobile browsing over laptop or desktop searches. This growing trend has created the need for online business owners to ensure that their website is optimized for mobile device viewing and has a user-friendly interface.</p>
<p>As simple as this may sound, many entrepreneurs struggle to implement SEO strategies effectively. The result is poor search engine rankings and foregone opportunities to make profits.</p>
<h2>How to Optimize Your E-Commerce SEO?</h2>
<p>You must strike when the iron is hot. Global events like Halloween, Christmas and Black Friday are prime days for e-commerce businesses to make profits and improve the visibility of their brand. However, you can’t yield the benefits of these events if you don’t even have an SEO strategy set up in the first place.</p>
<p>Everything from the content you post online to how your website is designed can play a crucial role in how well your business capitalizes on opportunities and converts them into a loyal customer base.</p>
<p><u><a href="../../../most-online-shoppers-are-using-search-engines-before-they-buy-2016-4.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nearly 35 percent</a></u> of customers come from organic search engine results. This means that there’s a broad market you can tap into if you occupy any of the top search result ranks. So how do you rank better on Google?</p>
<p>At Search Berg, we’ve mastered the art of SEO marketing. We’ve been offering our award-winning digital <u><a href="../../../seo-services/index.htm">SEO services</a></u> to clients all over the world and can provide you with optimized tools to help your business thrive!</p>
<p>Here are some of our best tips on a mandatory SEO checklist for small business owners and entrepreneurs aiming to go big this year!</p>
<h2>Part A: Website Architecture and Design</h2>
<p>The architecture and design of your website refer to the overall structure of your site, including the hosting server and the plug-ins and applications installed in it. Your website’s structure makes a huge difference in terms of how big your e-commerce store is.</p>
<p>A six-page website will likely load and operate faster compared to a thousand-page one. Using a Content Management System, however, can take the burden off of you to take care of your website since the design and operations are already programmed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1337" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b1-3.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="156"></p>
<p>Here are some things you can do to improve your website design.</p>
<h3>1. Simplify your Website’s Structure</h3>
<p>A complicated homepage structure can chase away even the most enthusiastic customers. Your website should always be UX and UI friendly. This means that your site visitors should be able to navigate their way to the product page under 3 clicks. Also, keep in mind that a <u><a href="../../../2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">responsive website design</a></u> that’s adaptable to mobile device viewing will improve your chances of getting visitors to stay on your site. This is known as dwell time and it works wonderfully to improve your business’s SEO rankings.</p>
<h3>2. Incorporate Breadcrumbs on Your Site</h3>
<p>Breadcrumbs are a navigational aid that tells the visitor what part of the website they’re on.</p>
<p>This feature should also be beneficial for your business since the right breadcrumb tags can make you more searchable.</p>
<p>When you first read about breadcrumb navigation for your site, it can sound rather confusing and abstract so let&#8217;s break it down.</p>
<p>Basically, the term comes from the tale Hansel and Gretel, in which Hansel leaves bread crumbs behind him so that they can navigate the path that they have walked to get to where they are.</p>
<p>Subsequently, breadcrumb navigation on your website is specifically designed to help your website visitor understand what path they have followed on your website&#8217;s pages to wind up on the page that they currently are at.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s akin to having left a trail of breadcrumbs behind them to navigate their path.</p>
<p>Traditionally the breadcrumb navigation feature is placed at the top of the web page so that the user can easily see it.</p>
<p>It will look something like: Home &gt; Blogs &gt; Breadcrumb blog piece &gt; Contact Us Page.</p>
<p>In this above case, the page that the user ended up on was the Contact Us page, and the breadcrumb tells them the story of how they navigated through the site to get there.</p>
<p>This ultimately helps the user understand your site structure and therefore navigate your site more easily to the pages that they want to access.</p>
<p>The key &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; which makes the breadcrumb navigation system work is that each &#8220;crumb&#8221; is linked so that the user can immediately skip back and forth to pages that they want to go to.</p>
<p>You may be wondering: how can this practice improve an Ecommerce site&#8217;s SEO for entrepreneurs and small business owners?</p>
<p>The answer is that Google actually uses breadcrumb navigation to crawl your website and place it into categories.</p>
<p>Therefore, if your site already has an effective breadcrumb navigation system in place, Google is much more likely to rank it on the first page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Optimize Links to your Site</h3>
<p>When it comes to organic searches, site links can help your visitors easily navigate the most important pages. These are usually the most frequently visited pages on your website.</p>
<p>It helps to add internal links to related products on your ecommerce site or even products that your other customers bought with the product in question.</p>
<p>This helps you up-scale your revenue and sales through up-selling your customers more products.</p>
<p>A smart way to include internal links is to use your keywords as the &#8220;call to action&#8221; rather than a generic phrase like &#8220;click over here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A key way to increase your authority as well as get some good internal links in is to create an About Us page.</p>
<p>This helps your target customer understand your company better, and if your mission is something they resonate with, they&#8217;re much more likely to regularly support you as a brand.</p>
<p>If you have specific product types that you specialize in, you can definitely link those pages in your About Us section.</p>
<p>Therefore, an About Us page is definitely something to add to your Ecommerce SEO checklist.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1334" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-3.jpg" alt="Optimize Links to your Site" width="750" height="483"></p>
<h2>Part B: On-Page SEO Tactics</h2>
<p><u><a href="../../../on-page-seo.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">On-page SEO</a></u> refers to the process of optimizing each page on your site, including the codes and content, to make them readable as search engine result pages. Small businesses that wish to boost their SEO rankings can and should definitely work on SEO page tactics.</p>
<p>Here’s what to focus on:</p>
<h3>1. Keywords</h3>
<p>Prepare a list of keywords you’d like to get ranked for.</p>
<p>Remember to own the keyword you choose; don’t spread your content so thinly that you don’t get ranked for anything.</p>
<p>Website crawlers are always on the lookout for content that features the right percentage of keyword-to-text ratio.</p>
<p>A keyword strategy that you should definitely take advantage of is to target long-tail keywords as much as possible.</p>
<p>This is because long-tail keywords are not only lower competition overall but also have a higher chance of bringing you conversions because of the sheer specificity with which a user is searching for something.</p>
<p>Find keywords that are relevant to your e-commerce store but don’t stuff them in meaningless prose. Search engines are a lot smarter than you think.</p>
<h3>2. Increase Your Page Speed</h3>
<p>We’ve talked about improving the loading speed of your website; now it’s time to talk about the operational speed of each page on your site.</p>
<p>Loading and buffering speeds are key indicators to Google’s algorithms on how to rank your page.</p>
<p>You can get in touch with Search Berg’s website development department to help you with this feature.</p>
<p>Having slow loading speeds definitely does not do favors for your Ecommerce SEO as an entrepreneur.</p>
<h3>3. Create Localized Landing Pages</h3>
<p>E-commerce stores can benefit from creating specific pages that target a particular kind of promotion.</p>
<p>The holiday season is specifically useful for this endeavor, since there are more searches guaranteed for particular keywords around those dates.</p>
<p>Aside from holiday events, it can also be beneficial to your site to create category pages with specific keywords.</p>
<p>An example of this could be &#8220;Women&#8217;s Soccer Shoes&#8221; or &#8220;Men&#8217;s Date Night Shoes,&#8221; depending on your keyword research.</p>
<p>The biggest keywords should definitely have a category of their own under which you can place smaller keywords that fit into the larger category.</p>
<p>If your landing page features something exciting like a giveaway or a competition, your visitors are likely to share your page on social media—earning your authentic links that will boost your SEO rank.</p>
<p>You can optimize your localized landing pages by immediately showing your visitors your most popular and most bought items within that genre.</p>
<p>This can immediately get the proverbial sales ball rolling.</p>
<p>Sales start flowing in using this technique because it gets people interested fast.</p>
<h3>4. Add Descriptions for Product Pages</h3>
<p>Promote your products by adding small description texts to entice potential buyers. Feel free to write descriptions however you want them. Here are some tips to keep in mind while writing them:</p>
<p>– Keep your description in the 300 to 700 word range.</p>
<p>– Pepper your text with internal links to other pages on your site.</p>
<p>– Add a customer review section to your product pages. Anytime someone types ‘reviews’ in the search bar can get linked to your product description pages.</p>
<p>– Communicate any and all special offers or discounts on your products.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re writing your product descriptions and titles, make sure to create a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>This applies even to crafting your meta descriptions for your organic search results on Google and other search engines.</p>
<p>A useful <strong>pro-tip</strong> for your Ecommerce SEO checklist for 2021 to create that sense of urgency is to use a countdown clock for specific deals and prices.</p>
<p>A bonus pro-tip that a lot of ad-copy writers use is to take full advantage of powerful words in your product descriptions and titles.</p>
<p>These specific words are timeless and have been tested to psychologically prime your visitors to invest in products.</p>
<p>While there are many power words out there for you to research, <a href="../../../sites/richardkestenbaum/2018/04/15/words-that-will-help-you-sell-and-words-that-will-hurt-you/index.htm?sh=460f1cdb2ecf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> should help you get started.</p>
<h2>Part C: Off-Page SEO Strategies</h2>
<p>No Ecommerce SEO checklist for entrepreneurs and small business owners is complete without off-page SEO Tactics.</p>
<p>A lot of the work that goes into improving your e-commerce business’s search engine ranking happens offline. Off-page SEO is slightly different from writing a blog or optimizing your web page.</p>
<p>Here, we deal with topics like offering sponsorships for certain events, partnering with local businesses within your industry and improving your outreach with white hat link building techniques. Let’s discuss each one of them in a little more detail.</p>
<h3>1. Link Building Strategies</h3>
<p>The simplest way to build authentic links is to promote a product, service or event.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1338" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b2-3.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="156"></p>
<p>Insert them into all of your content, but in ways that make them look like a natural fit and not a forced block of promotional text.</p>
<p>You can also embed links into the images you upload onto your website. <u><a href="../../../library/google.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google’s algorithms</a></u> will take that into consideration when they’re building your SEO rank.</p>
<p>One key strategy to find places that can link to your site is to see which sites are linking to your competitors.</p>
<p>You can easily build links on forums and directories that your competitors have built links on already.</p>
<p>A key place to also find an easy backlink is to get in touch with your manufacturer and ask them to link to you as a merchant for their product on their website.</p>
<p>If they aren&#8217;t forums or submission-based directories, you can also reach out to the websites linking to your competitors and ask for a link to your site.</p>
<p>If you ship your product internationally, it can also help you to check international competitors in the countries you can ship to.</p>
<p>Then repeat the same practice for the websites that are linking to your international competitors&#8217; ecommerce websites.</p>
<h3>2. Develop Industry Partnerships</h3>
<p>This is perhaps the most important element of off-page SEO marketing. Get in touch with local industry e-commerce website owners and build a reciprocal promotional deal. Ask them to link your business on their content and offer them something in return.</p>
<p>You can even hire some already high-ranking online businesses to serve as licensed distributors for your products. From white hat link building to the chance to reach out to a larger consumer base, there are many benefits to expanding your industry partnerships.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1335" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-3.jpg" alt="Develop Industry Partnerships" width="750" height="483"></p>
<h3>3. Embrace the Sponsorship Culture</h3>
<p>Getting your products sponsored by a third party website is actually easier than you think. There are many blogs that would happily promote your products. You can also opt to sponsor an event and request your partners to promote you on their website and on-ground activities. This should help put your e-commerce brand’s name on the SEO map.</p>
<h3>4. Reach Out to Bloggers</h3>
<p><u><a href="../../../how-to-get-influencers-to-promote-you/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bloggers</a></u> bring in loads of traffic and a loyal fan base with them. Get your small business’s name out there by having bloggers feature you on their blogs. You don’t even need to get anything major done for a promotion—simply ask them to link back to your home or product page and you’re surely going to have a lot of their traffic directed to your pages. Many bloggers would be willing to promote you for free; however, some will ask you for some compensation. The choice is yours.</p>
<h3>5. Start Guest Posting</h3>
<p>Backlinks are crucial for improving your SEO rank. You can use those and harness the power of online influencers to create a solid SEO marketing strategy for your small business to bloom. Ask popular blog owners or local industry groups to let you publish a guest post for them. You’ll be able to convince them better if you already have a few topics in mind. Try to work on something that benefits both of you. In most cases, your partner will agree to guest posting since the backlinks benefit their SEO rank as well.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1336" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4-1.jpg" alt="Start Guest Posting" width="750" height="483"></p>

		<p>When it comes to running a small business, entrepreneurs often feel the pressure to market their brand without going over the budget. Finding convenient and affordable promotion options can be a difficult task, but that’s where <a href="../../seo-marketing.html">SEO marketing</a> comes in.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1302" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1.jpg" alt="Link Building Services and Strategies for Websites and Small Businesses" width="750" height="483"></p>
<p>SEO marketing is a highly effective way to promote your business and not just for the short term. With the right services, you can ensure your top spot at Google’s search engine rankings consistently.</p>
<p>However, there are some things you’d want to heed caution over. One major problem with promoting your business online is that if you’re not well-versed with SEO, you might end up using keyword-stuffed pages on low-quality links. Not only does this affect your search engine rankings, but it also signs you up for <a href="../../../the-complete-list-of-google-penalties-and-how-to-recover/201510/index.htm">SEO penalties</a>.</p>
<p>But with the help of an established <a href="../../../index.htm">digital SEO marketing agency</a> like Search Berg, you can get white hat SEO strategies to boost the visibility of your local business. We believe in the power of link building to help steer small businesses to the top of Google’s search results page. In today’s blog, we’ll show you how you can build links that will benefit the growth of your online business!</p>
<h2>1. Initiate Partnerships with Other Local Businesses</h2>
<p>The essence of link building lies in networking. You need businesses to link back to your website so your business grows in credibility, yields more traffic and climbs up the SEO ranks. However, local businesses will only want to feature you on their website if they feel like they have some connection to your work—without feeling like you’re an outright competitor.</p>
<p>For example, if you sell cat food then you should get in touch with vets, cat grooming salons and pet shelter businesses.</p>
<p>Now, as an entrepreneur, you’d know the importance of providing incentives to get work done. Likewise, when you’re building links, try to offer rewards like discounts to some of your customers who link or refer to your business on their website. The more relationships you build, the more attention your business will get.</p>
<h2>2. Contribute to Local Organizations or Events</h2>
<p>While you keep forging new networks within your local industry, it’ll help to offer sponsorships to local not-for-profit organizations. A sponsorship can easily put you on the map and if you’re aligned with your partner organization’s values, then you can also tap into a broader market segment.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for arts and music festivals, conferences and other events that could potentially bring in more customers for you. As a promotion for the event begins, your business’s name will be on pretty much every online poster and newsletter published by that organization. This will improve your chance to build authentic links within the local community.</p>
<h2>3. Become a Member of a Professional Organization that has Access to Directories</h2>
<p>When it comes to the local industry, different cities have different chambers that are built to cater to a specific business demographic. For example, a <a href="../../../chamber-people.html">chamber of commerce</a> can be dedicated to uplifting minority groups within your community.</p>
<p>Many such professional organizations have links to these industry chambers and winning a link with them could work brilliantly for you. Keep an eye out for organizations that are relevant to you and the ones that offer membership with directory access.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1306" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="156"></p>
<h2>4. Host a Fundraiser or Charity Drive</h2>
<p>Becoming part of community events is a great strategy to build legitimate links. Not only do you get to support a good cause, but people are more likely to share links and spread the word regarding such events.</p>
<p>Once non-profits begin promoting your support on their website, local bloggers and journalists are going to be interested in featuring you on their story. It’s a good way to win your business some press coverage.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2.jpg" alt="Host a Fundraiser or Charity Drive" width="750" height="483"></p>
<h2> 5. Get into Content Marketing</h2>
<p>Fresh and relevant content is a huge aspect of link building. When you post something new, other websites have a reason to link back to you. Make sure you have a blog portal on your website that you regularly update.</p>
<p>Now, content marketing can get extremely competitive since there are lots of businesses that are using this method to build links. However, your focus shouldn’t be to compete with all these businesses; just focus on the local industry that serves your target market.</p>
<p>When it comes to reaching out to your clients via content marketing, you need to write about something that’s useful to them and is presented in a locally relevant context. Try to produce work on topics that work for you and your community members.</p>
<p>For example, if you own a shop that sells ATVs and scooters, you can write a blog about the best spots in town to ride your one-person vehicle.</p>
<h2>6. Get in Touch with Local Bloggers</h2>
<p>Bloggers come with an established reader fan base and can help you market content that’s new and relevant to locals. Make the first move and get in touch with bloggers who’d be interested in partnering with you. Ask them to cover something related to your website or put in a positive review for your business.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1307" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b2.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="156"></p>
<h2>7. Keep an Eye Out for Local Round-up Pages</h2>
<p>You’ve probably seen online content with some kind of countdown or a list of the best businesses in a particular industry; these are round-up pages.</p>
<p>Round up pages are location-specific and are usually ranked highly on search engine results. This means these pages are going to get plenty of clicks and visitor traffic. Figure out what categories or tags your business could fit into and try to get in touch with the writer for a promotion link. Even if they’re not ready to feature you in the upcoming list, they can shortlist your business for future references.</p>
<h2>8. Write Guest Posts</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a reliable white hat linking strategy, then guest posts are going to be your best bet. Guest posting promotes both ways; you and the website business you’re writing for.</p>
<p>Small businesses, in particular, can benefit from guest posting because they don’t have to pay or make any offers to anyone for promotion. You’re essentially putting your business out there by writing for someone else’s audience.</p>
<p>Do some research on local blogs that are useful for your business and are willing to partner with you on guest posts.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> Pitch your proposal for guest posting with a relevant topic that works for both, you and your partner. That way, you can insert links back to your website in a natural way, without it ever seeming forced.</p>
<h2>9. Build Broken Links</h2>
<p>Broken links are a bane for many online businesses, but the solution to it is fairly simple. Keep your eyes peeled for local industry websites that have broken page links. Alert the website owners about the problem and offer them your website link as a replacement.</p>
<p>It might seem too good to be true, but this strategy works precisely because fixing broken links helps that website’s SEO ranks and your website serves as a quick and convenient fix for their problem.</p>
<p>Try to get in touch with businesses that deal with similar products or services because that way it becomes easier for you to convince them that you’re a good replacement for their site.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3.jpg" alt="Build Broken Links" width="750" height="483"></p>
<h2> 10. Practice Awards and Giveaways</h2>

		<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1267" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1.png" alt="small business" width="625" height="357"></p>
<p>Getting your small business or startup in the public limelight would have been considered an arduous challenge a decade ago. Today’s entrepreneurs have the advantageous possibility of advertising their business on search engines—and it’s called <a href="../../../guide/what-is-seo.html">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO).</p>
<p><a href="../../../index.htm">SEO</a> is a crucial element of any digital marketing for any small business striving to succeed. Most people hop on Google whenever they’re searching for a service or product. If your website is ranking on the first pages for these targeted search terms, then your chances of improving web traffic, enhancing customer interaction and securing a conversion increases tremendously.</p>
<p>In today’s post, we’re going to be talking about <a href="../../the-2019-seo-roadmap-for-small-businesses-that-every-startup-or-company-should-use-if-they-want-to-rank-high-in-google-and-get-new-clients/index.htm">Small Business SEO tips</a> that collectively play a pivotal role in bringing about these conversion. As one of the leading <a href="../../../seo-service/small-business-seo/index.htm">Small Business SEO agency</a> in the United States, we have put together 20 tips that you must incorporate in your SEO campaign.</p>
<h2>1. Make sure your web copies are written for humans</h2>
<p>Search engines are much smarter than you think. They can tell apart an organic sentence, link, and paragraph from forced ones. Don’t make the mistake of stuffing keywords on your website or keep talking about the same topics. It’s never worked before, and it won’t work for you any time soon.</p>
<h2>2. Narrow down your keyword list to use for your entire website</h2>
<p>There’s no SEO without keywords. However, you don’t guarantee any visibility for search terms if you’ve got pretty much every keyword stuffed into the mix. The aim is to develop ownership for a particular set of keywords, so if anyone looks it up, you’re the first result they get.</p>
<h2>3. Use Keyword Rich URLs for Landing Pages</h2>
<p>If you want to know how to make domain names that are rich in the right keywords you can simply Google the results for your choice of keywords. For example, if your business sells men’s shoes then your folder and domain pages should clearly mention these two terms something like this:  <em>http://www.yourdomainname.com/mens-shoes/mens-shoes-foldername.html.</em></p>
<h2>4. Don’t Go Overboard with Keyword Density</h2>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the total number of keywords and related phrases that you have on your page should be somewhere <a href="../../../keyword-density-seo.html">between 3 and 6 percent</a> of the total written content and links on a page. This rule goes beyond your homepage. Indeed, from an SEO point of view, it makes up nearly half of your search criterion but it’s important to have the rest of your pages contribute to the rankings too. For this, you’ll need to ensure that there’s a certain theme that’s being followed across all pages because the more of them are ranked, the greater are your website’s chances of climbing up the SEO ranks.</p>
<h2>5. Titles are Entitled To Be Different For Each Page</h2>
<p>Switch up your keyword phrases and mix up their combinations in a way that the first few words in your title are SEO-friendly. Also, try to keep all phrases under 70 characters.</p>
<h2>6. Insert a Unique Meta Description For Each Page</h2>
<p>Any time you look up a phrase on a search engine you’ll notice a small piece of text accompanying every title. That’s a Meta description. It’s like a summary of your webpage but it’s also a very convincing call to action. For example:“Buy stylish shoes for men today! We offer free shipping for all locally made shoes. For more information give us a call at 123 45.”</p>
<p>Try to keep the Meta description under 150 characters.</p>
<h2>7. Don’t Forget to Style Your Keywords</h2>
<p>Keyword styles can really change the game. You need the search engines to pick up your keywords as organically as possible. For this purpose, using bold or italic fonts and header tags are crucial. If you’re not sure how to go about this one, try some <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-css-cascading-style-sheet/">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) to match the layout and format with that of your website.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1268" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2.png" alt="Style Your Keywords" width="628" height="420"></p>
<h2>8. Add ALT Tags Your Images</h2>
<p>Whenever you’re naming your images, remember to insert your keywords and related phrases into the Alt tags as well. The contextual reference provided by Alt tags can really help pull your pages up the rankings.</p>
<h2>9. Smart inter-linking is Intelligent interlinking</h2>
<p>We’ve seen plenty of websites use internal links but very few of them do it right. Any time you have the opportunity to insert keywords to your webpages—do it! Again, specificity in links is important.</p>
<h2>10. Create an XML Sitemap</h2>
<p>When your internal linking game is weak, it helps to have an XML sitemap that leads Google through all the most important pages on your website. In fact, all search engines love an XML site map.</p>
<p>This brings us to the next point.</p>
<h2>11. A Simple, Straightforward robots.txt File Is The Way to Go</h2>
<p>These are files that can be considered a web crawler’s best friend. They tell search engines all the important details on what pages are allowed to be shown on their index. Now here’s a neat SEO trick; insert your XML sitemap location onto the robot TXT file so you don’t have to provide details to search engines on all URLs—now they can find it automatically!</p>
<h2>12. Your Website Must Have external links</h2>
<p>SEO-friendly websites are those that aren’t afraid to link other related websites. The impact is greater when you’re linking to businesses and groups that are local—not just in terms of the city or state but also in terms of being in the same industry. Also, don’t forget to use keywords with all your external links!</p>
<h2>13. Update Your Website With New Content Frequently</h2>
<p>Of every SEO tip that we’ve mentioned here so far, we have a feeling that you’re probably worried the most about new content. Where do you get all that new information?</p>
<p>Don’t worry, we’ll help you! We’ve produced over 20,000 SEO projects and are still going strong! We can help you churn out relevant content and add new pages to your site so you’re getting recommendations from others in your industry frequently.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1269" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.png" alt="Update Your Website With New Content Frequently" width="628" height="460"></p>
<h2>14. Make Sure You Are Getting Links from the Right People</h2>
<p>You want to get links from all the popular websites in your industry. By popular, we mean the ones that rank on top. Make it a point to check the ranks of your chosen websites and ask them to link to you so you can link back to them. To make this effort more effective, give them a list of keywords that should go into the text. Emailing your peers can seem labor intensive but trust us; links from local industries can help your SEO ranking soar high in no time.</p>
<h2>15. Create a Linkable Page</h2>
<p>When you want link-backs from visitors to your website, you need to make it as easy as possible for them to do the job. Create a page with your logos and keyword-laden text links and send them to your visitors, customers and subscribers.</p>
<h2>16. Broaden your SEO horizons</h2>
<p>Don’t just stay cooped up in the corner of the SEO rankings with some trusty keywords and phrases. Make the online community feel your presence. You can do this by writing guest blogs for popular websites and industry leaders. You can also start your own blog and integrate with your website and social media pages. Perhaps, even submit some reviews or answer questions on <a href="../../../ServiceLogin-1.html">chat forums</a> and <a href="../../../index-135.htm">online knowledge communities</a>. However, know when to stop because overdoing it can get you listed as a spammer.</p>
<h2>17. Get your website listed on various directories</h2>
<p>Online directories have been with us for a long time and because of their high reputation search engines are likely to scan them for updated links. Note that some of these directories will require you to pay a small fee.However, the advantage of hiring a <a href="../../../local-seo-services/index.htm">local SEO service firm</a> is that you can get access to directory lists for a fraction of the cost.</p>
<h2>18. Cement your online presence with a little creativity</h2>
<p>It’s tempting to chain down your content behind subscription fees and other exclusive membership programs but it helps to make a lot of your content available free of cost. Think of it this way, if you’re posting about giveaways, discount codes, contest prizes, tutorials and other freebies people are more likely to link to you and pass on the information. It’s a win-win situation for your small business!</p>
<h2>19.  Syndicate Your Press Release Documents</h2>
<p>Press releases are a great way to boost your outreach and become visible to an audience beyond your target market. Any time you’ve introduced a new service or have created a new product, it’s time to send out a local or national press release.</p>
<h2>20. Get listed on Google My Business</h2>
<p>Getting listed on Google My Business or Google Places is a heavyweight move in the world of SEO marketing.This should improve your visibility for local searches and your small business should show up in the form of a Google Map too!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1270" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4.png" alt="Getting listed on Google My Business" width="628" height="390"></p>

		<p>Struggling to find clients for your bathroom remodeling business?</p>
<p>According to studies, <a href="../../home-remodeling-expected-to-remain-strong-and-steady-into-2019.html">home renovations</a> are currently on the rise and are expected to continue growing throughout the year. Some attribute this increase in home improvement projects to strengthening employment conditions and the heavy price tags of new homes. Bathroom remodeling, in particular, has gained massive popularity among homeowners in recent years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="http://streaming.yayimages.com/images/photographer/feverpitched/9ebcb7ef2e269091af8b27dfb6570402/hand-of-architect-on-computer-tablet-showing-bathroom-details-ov.jpg" width="1000" height="666"></p>
<p>The National Association of Home Builders conducted a Remodeling Marketing Index survey in 2018 according to which <a href="../../../2018/05/remodeling-in-2017-baths-reclaim-top-spot-from-kitchens/index.htm">bathroom remodeling</a> was the most common remodeling project, cited by more than 80% of home remodelers.</p>
<p>While experts consider this to be a positive trend, it has given rise to intense competition in the remodeling industry. In order to keep up with this rising competition, bathroom remodelers need to up their marketing game and use every channel to attract prospective clients.</p>
<p>One way to do that is by having a strong online presence and partnering with an agency that provides SEO for bathroom remodeling companies. As a vast majority of homeowners looking to upgrade their kitchen or bathroom begin their search for remodeling contractors online, having a business website can work in your favor. Instead of locating your office and scheduling an appointment with your team, interested individuals can use your remodeling website to gather all the data they need with minimum hassle.</p>
<p>However, merely having a functioning website isn’t enough. There are certain elements of web design capable of boosting your website’s reach and generating more traffic.</p>
<p>Wondering what those are?</p>
<p>Here are some of the top website essentials driving traffic and SEO for bathroom remodelers:</p>
<h2>1.     Simple Navigation</h2>
<p>The purpose of your website is to advertise your bathroom remodeling solutions. Having a website with a haphazard, cluttered design can make it difficult for your visitors to find information about your services. This is the reason why websites that are hard to navigate through tend to have a higher bounce rate than those with simpler navigation.</p>
<p>If you already have a website, de-clutter it with the help of professional developers to ensure that it’s distraction-free and user-friendly.</p>
<h2>2.     Responsive Design</h2>
<p>We can’t stress this enough. A website with a responsive design that adjusts itself according to screen sizes of different devices is more important now than ever before. With consumer bases of all industries abandoning conventional shopping methods and using smartphones to shop online, websites with responsive designs have turned into a necessity for commercial set-ups.</p>
<p>Having a responsive design will ensure that those visiting your remodeling website through their phones will have access to the same or similar information available to desktop users.</p>
<h2>3.     An ‘About Us’ Page</h2>
<p>Most people looking for a bathroom remodeling service provider online aren’t in need of an urgent solution. They’d much rather learn more about you, your company, how long you’ve been in the business, and the remodeling services you’re capable of providing before making a decision for themselves.</p>
<p>This is why it’s important to have a comprehensive ‘About Us’ page on your site that covers the foundations of your firm, your current status as a bathroom remodeling contractor and everything in between.</p>
<h2>4.     An Extensive Portfolio</h2>
<p>Nothing attracts prospective clients like a well-maintained portfolio displaying the skills of your team. Adding photos of your work to your website will build their expectations regarding the quality of your services.</p>
<p>You can choose a conventional carousel-style gallery or display your projects in a before-and-after duo to allow your visitors to compare the results side by side. Make sure the images have a high-resolution and are taken from angles that complement the lighting and accents in the remodeled bathroom.</p>
<h2>5.     A Testimonials Section</h2>
<p>Remodeling projects can take anywhere from a few hundred to thousands of dollars, depending on the extent of change people are planning to make to their existing structures. As remodeling is a hefty investment, most people prefer having some kind of tangible proof of your past experience and project management abilities. A testimonials section on your website can provide just that.</p>
<p>Not only do testimonials and reviews help in leaving a positive first impression, but they also offer SEO benefits and boost your rankings in search engine results.</p>

		<p>Marketing has experienced a significant shift in the last few decades. Businesses from a diverse range of industries are now abandoning old-school TV and billboard based techniques and using the internet as a channel through which they can connect with foreign consumers and expand their global reach. In fact, marketers across the globe have reportedly shrunk their conventional advertising budgets up to <a href="../../../digital-marketing/10-statistics-top-digital-marketing-strategies-2015-01112002.html#W9rZF61i5RTfAUr6.97">28%</a> to inflate the size of their digital marketing budget.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="http://streaming.yayimages.com/images/photographer/welcomia/a57fa1c2b00b7602aee60f6d4459625a/line-of-brand-new-cars.jpg" width="1006" height="662"></p>
<p>This shift in marketing trends has revolutionized modern automotive dealerships. Instead of listing their inventory in local newspapers or TV commercials, car dealers can now advertise to their target audiences through their websites. Customers can also use the internet to compare prices and their experience with dealers, which allows dealers to build credibility and use feedback to improve their operations.</p>
<p>However, with more and more auto dealers building their online identities, competition in the digital realm is rising. Car dealerships need to stay on top of the latest digital marketing trends and implement the same, in order to stand out and attract prospective customers.</p>
<p>Here are some SEO techniques driving the future of digital automotive marketing.</p>
<h2>Make Your Site Mobile-Friendly</h2>
<p>More than half of the <a href="../../../business/press-releases/2016-new-autoshopper-study.html">individuals shopping for cars</a> over the internet use mobile devices to browse through available options, according to studies. Unresponsive websites incapable of adjusting their elements according to screen sizes of various smart devices can make it difficult for visitors to view available vehicles. Poor user experience may drive prospective leads away from your website, increasing your bounce rate and ultimately leaving a negative impact on the website’s Google rankings. So if your site doesn’t have a responsive, mobile-friendly design, consult trusted web developers to upgrade it and optimize it for search engines.</p>
<h2>Earn Reviews to Build a Reputation</h2>
<p>Search engines sort web pages on the basis of their relevance to a query and their perceived popularity among web surfers. This is why online reviews play a crucial role in building a positive reputation and increasing your search engine result rankings. Begin by introducing a reviews or testimonials page on your website. Next, try reaching out to your existing customer base via email, text or any other channel and request them to describe their experience with your dealership. You can also consult a reputation management firm and let professionals handle this for you.</p>
<h2>Harness the Power of Google My Business</h2>
<p>Google My Business is a platform launched by Google, which allows brands to gain local exposure and efficiently manage their online presence. All you need to do is provide relevant information regarding your dealership, which will place you on Google’s listings. GMB then uses the provided information to create a Google Maps location that is synced to your Google search, which makes it easier for people to find your page.</p>
<h2>Implement Schema Mark-Up</h2>
<p>Integration of schema mark-up is one of the key SEO trends shaping the future of digital marketing at the moment. It’s involves using code to help site crawlers understand the content of your website in a better way. Schema markup implementation allows search engines to distinguish between different types of information on your site and display it in search results accordingly.</p>
<p>For example, if your website is using schema mark-up, Google will be able to determine whether the numbers listed in your web content make up your business contact number or are a part of your postal code. Schema mark-up improves online visibility and increases the possibility of your target audience members finding your site.</p>
<h2>Get Citations</h2>
<p>Search engines value web pages that are credible. This is why it’s important to build your website’s credibility to boost SEO and generate web traffic. An approach to this issue can be to get as many citations as possible, from other websites. You can choose to list your business in local business directories or online platforms specifically developed to help people find auto dealerships.</p>
<p>Digital marketing holds immense power in modern day and age. Following the techniques we’ve mentioned, you can steer your auto dealership’s digital marketing to success. However, for prompt and efficient results, it’s always better to consult professional SEO specialists.</p>
