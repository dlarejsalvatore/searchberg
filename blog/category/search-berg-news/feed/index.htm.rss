<p>Is your staircase decked out with boughs of holly? Can you smell the fresh pine scent of your ornate Christmas tree? Have you embellished your fireplace with stockings, garlands, figurines, Advent calendars, and tinsel?<span id="more-2381"></span></p>
<p>As we wave 2020 goodbye and look forward to new beginnings, it’s time to spend some much-needed time with our loved ones and unwind. On behalf of the entire team at Search Berg, we’d like to wish you a very merry (and safe) Christmas!</p>
<p>As we celebrate the holidays this year, it’s hard not to notice that something is amiss. Many of us are putting last-minute touches to Christmas decorations without our loved ones around. If you’re spending the holidays away from your family, we’d like to send extra love your way. As we start afresh, we’re hopeful that 2021 will welcome new beginnings replete with health and happiness.</p>
<p>In the meantime, virtually connect with your loved ones, shower them with Christmas goodies, and don’t forget to treat yourself! 2020 has been a rollercoaster, to say the least. If you haven’t managed to make some time for yourself, make sure you spend the holidays watching your favorite Christmas movies, checking a couple items off your wishlist, and practicing gratitude.</p>
<p>Gear up for the upcoming year with newfound enthusiasm, energy, and joy by giving yourself some TLC this holiday season.</p>
<p>As for your digital marketing plans, we’ll be right here to help you double down on performance following the holidays! Let’s take this time to recharge and return better than ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><b>Once again, happy holidays!</b></strong></p>
