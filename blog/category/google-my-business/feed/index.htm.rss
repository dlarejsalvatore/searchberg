<h3>Stuck with not-so-great Google My Business growth?<br />
Get back on track with <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/gmb-optimization/"><span class="orange">GMB Optimization services</span></a>!</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you’ve claimed your free GMB profile, you’re on the right track. Make sure you follow that up with stellar optimization and promotion. Here’s a guide to help you get started!</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc58350016"></a>How to Optimize Your Google My Business Listing</h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc58350017"></a>Don’t Leave Any Section Unfilled</h3>
<p>As one of the best practices for Google My Business optimization, <em>detailing</em> works like a charm. Start by ensuring NAP (name, address, and phone number) accuracy and consistency. Your Google My Business profile should feature the same NAP that’s on your website, social media pages, business card, and online listings.</p>
<p>Make sure there’s no inconsistency. Each hyphen, asterisk, and number should be consistent across the board. This is a great way to add a touch of legitimacy to your listing, which will help you make your way to one of the coveted ranks of the <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/what-is-googles-local-3-pack-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-rank/">Google 3-Pack</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’ve taken care of the basics, take a quick look at your profile. Are there any unfilled sections? In many cases, businesses fill out the basics and leave the details for later. If you’ve resorted to the same approach, undo the damage, stat.</p>
<p>Your Google My Business profile should be accurately filled out. Focus on these details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Business hours</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Attributes</li>
<li>Questions and answers</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Some details are consumer-generated, including questions and answers and reviews. But don’t wait for your audience to take care of them. Instead, adopt a proactive approach and prompt customers to leave reviews (more on this later).</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse of a meticulously completed Google My Business listing:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-12.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2370" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-12.png" alt="Don’t Leave Any Section Unfilled" width="504" height="491" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-11.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2369" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-11.png" alt="Don’t Leave Any Section Unfilled" width="508" height="310" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-10.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2368" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-10.png" alt="Don’t Leave Any Section Unfilled4" width="511" height="465" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-9.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2367" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-9.png" alt="Don’t Leave Any Section Unfilled5" width="512" height="446" /></a></p>
<p>Google’s algorithm expertly crawls, indexes, and ranks listings based on the accuracy, consistency, quality, and comprehensiveness of the information provided.</p>
<p>If your profile features information that checks off these boxes, you have a better shot at appearing among the top search results for local searches. Over time, this optimization trick will help you engage and convert more local customers, resulting in bigger and better sales.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc58350018"></a>Share Engaging Posts on a Weekly Basis</h3>
<p>Consistency is inarguably one of the best Google My Business tricks you’ll stumble across. While you may have filled out your profile like a seasoned pro, posting every once in a while will take a toll on your rankings. Instead, make sure you share engaging, unique, and value-added posts on a weekly basis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-8.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2366" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-8.png" alt="Share Engaging Posts on a Weekly Basis2" width="357" height="344" /></a></p>
<p>Include a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/12/26/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CTA (call-to-action)</a> toward the end of each post to prompt action. You can also post about special discounts, clearance sales, and ongoing offers to redirect your target audience to your site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-7.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2365" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-7.png" alt="Share Engaging Posts on a Weekly Basis" width="396" height="367" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-6.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-6.png" alt="Sharing content " width="397" height="211" /></a></p>
<p>Sharing content more frequently will help you boost your online presence and stand out from the crowd—both literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>Google doesn’t accept posts that are longer than 300 words, so stick to the word limit. Strike the perfect balance between brevity and value to ensure each post packs a powerful punch. Remember, there are no bounds here. You can choose to post about anything: a new product/service launch, a milestone, behind-the-scenes footage, exclusive offers, etc.</p>

<p>Using keywords is part and parcel of targeting a local audience. If your <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/seo-keyword-research/">keyword research strategy</a> is subpar, take active measures to turn things around.</p>
<p>Start by identifying industry-specific keywords like “legal support,” “plumbing services,” “interior design,” etc. Based on your industry, shortlist 5–10 relevant keywords with high search volume. In addition, research location-specific keywords based on where you offer your products/services.</p>
<p>Once you’ve covered these two key bases, compile a list of relevant trending keywords. Are there certain holidays, events, or pop culture references that are trending in your area? Think “Christmas,” “Valentine’s Day,” “Super Bowl,” and the like.</p>
<p>Anything and everything that’s a hot trend goes! And if it’s relevant to your industry, you’ve struck gold. For instance, sharing a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/ken-bone-and-the-legend-of-the-undecided-voter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ken Bone-themed</a> post to promote red shirts would’ve been a genius move for apparel stores in 2016.</p>
<p>Once you have a set of winning keywords, use them on your profile and in your posts. But don’t go overboard. Keyword stuffing can put you at risk of getting penalized by Google. The right balance will help you target a wide local audience and boost your listing.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that Google highlights relevant keywords in reviews. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-5.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2363" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-5.png" alt="Use High-Ranking Keywords" width="507" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Sounds like something that cannot be leveraged, right? Well, not quite. Requesting specific reviews is a great way to give Google exactly what it needs to rank your listing in the Google 3-Pack.</p>
<p>For instance, if you run a restaurant, ask customers for feedback regarding your customer service, specific menu items, ambiance, etc. This will help you generate reviews that are right up Google’s alley.</p>
<p>The outcome? A listing that ranks higher and generates more local traffic in the long run.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc58350020"></a>Answer Pending Questions</h3>
<p>Questions and answers can make or break a Google My Business listing. Let’s say you’re looking for 24/7 packing and moving services in New York. If a business has specifically answered a question about 24/7 availability, it’ll show up among the top search results. You can easily browse through multiple listings and choose the right option based on the specific Q&amp;As provided.</p>
<p>This neat trick helps customers save time and businesses attract the right audience. Make sure your Google My Business profile is replete with relevant Q&amp;As. We suggest searching for industry-specific FAQs and listing your own Q&amp;As accordingly.</p>
<p>In addition, make sure you answer relevant questions that are posted on your profile. However, avoid responding to each question. This will help you steer clear of repetition. You’ll also manage to weed out irrelevant questions.</p>
<p>Here are some examples to steer you in the right direction:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-4.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2362 aligncenter" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-4.png" alt="Answer Pending Questions1" width="641" height="273" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-3.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2361 aligncenter" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-3.png" alt="Answer Pending Questions2" width="629" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-2.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2360 aligncenter" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-2.png" alt="Answer Pending Questions3" width="633" height="243" /></a></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc58350021"></a>Post High-Quality Audiovisual Content</h3>
<p>If your Google My Business profile doesn’t feature high-quality images and videos, you’ll struggle to make a winning impact on your audience. From the cover photo to the videos, the audiovisual content featured on your page should be a treat for your audience! You can also provide a 360-degree street view for a better look at your outlet.</p>
<p>Showcase your products/services, share company culture videos, and capture some behind-the-scenes footage to give your audience the ultimate experience before they get a chance to transact with you. The better the content, the better your chances of making great sales!</p>
<p>Sharing high-quality content will also help you improve brand identity and recall, resulting in enhanced audience retention in the long run. As always, update photos and videos on a bi-yearly basis. If certain images don’t reflect your business anymore, make sure you post a fresh batch of content and indicate the changes (renovations, etc.).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc58350022"></a>Engage With Customer Reviews</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2359 size-full" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2-1.png" alt="Engage With Customer Reviews" width="389" height="502" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to optimizing your Google My Business page, leveraging reviews is your best bet. Reviews carry massive conversion potential. They add an air of legitimacy to your business, resulting in better engagement and sales.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can make the most of them. Start by requesting more reviews through your website, social media pages, and online listings. You can also create a specific page for reviews on your website. Hyperlink said page in the CTAs for your blogs, articles, and online posts. You can also send a link to your audience via email for better reach!</p>
<p>If you’re still struggling to generate plentiful positive reviews, incentivize customers by offering discounts. While this may sound a little over-the-top, it’s essential. Ensuring a steady stream of flattering reviews will help you snag a spot on the Google 3-Pack and skyrocket conversions.</p>
<p>Apart from going the extra mile to request reviews, we also recommend engaging with each review for better reach. Thank your audience for leaving positive reviews and promise to make amends with regard to negative reviews (make sure you follow through).</p>
<p>Over time, you can also begin to request specific reviews to highlight different aspects of your business. Keep industry-specific keywords in mind! Based on the search preferences of your target audience, request relevant reviews to help Google showcase your business.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of this powerful strategy, it’ll become second nature to you. Not only will you marvel at the results, but you’ll also wonder why it took you so long to kick-start a strategy that’s so simple.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc58350023"></a>Set Up Messaging</h3>
<p>Enabling messaging is a great way to make it easier for your audience to reach you. Customers can directly send you text messages and receive prompt replies to their queries. As you break down the barriers in business–customer communication, you’ll manage to facilitate more transactions.</p>
<p>In many cases, web users end up delaying a potential purchase because they’re in a state of limbo. No matter how specific your Q&amp;As may be, you can’t cover all the bases. It’s very likely that certain web users will still require answers to unique queries. Setting up messaging will help you cover these gaps and make your listing more responsive.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc58350024"></a>Leverage Special Attributes</h3>
<p>Based on your industry and business, you have the option of leveraging special attributes to make your business more discoverable. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2358 size-full" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog2.png" alt="Leverage Special Attributes " width="507" height="257" /></a></p>
<p>These attributes play a big role in allowing web users to choose the right business among a pool of relevant listings.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, make sure you get as specific as possible. If your outlet offers free Wi-Fi, include it as a special attribute on your Google My Business listing!</p>
<p>Featuring a set of highly-specific special attributes will help your listing stand out.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc58350025"></a>How to Promote Your Google My Business Listing</h2>
<p>While optimizing your Google My Business page is important, it’s not the be-all and end-all of mastering local visibility.</p>
<p>In addition to optimization, make sure you have a razor-sharp focus on promotion.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best Google My Business promotion strategies to help you get off on the right foot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by creating and sharing a link to your listing (click <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/7503826?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Once you’ve set up a unique URL for your Google My Business listing, you can share it with your customers to <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/7035772?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">request reviews</a> or boost your profile.</li>
<li>Make sure your website features links to your Google reviews and directions. This is a neat trick to help your listing get more traction!</li>
<li>While you may feel tempted to experiment with spammy tactics, avoid them at all costs. You’ll risk getting penalized by Google. Instead, focus on organic growth.</li>
<li>Google My Business frequently releases new tools. Explore the <a href="https://marketingkit.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Marketing Kit</a> to give your listing an edge.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While digital marketing has been the cornerstone of running a successful local business for at least a decade, its importance has grown manifold in 2020.</p>



<p><span id="more-1645"></span></p>



<p><em>Why?</em></p>



<p>According to research, the <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/8-reasons-to-protect-your-brands-online-reputation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">COVID-19 lockdown</a> has pushed internet use by a whopping <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markbeech/2020/03/25/covid-19-pushes-up-internet-use-70-streaming-more-than-12-first-figures-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">70%</a>!</p>



<p>And that’s not all.</p>



<p>While the lockdown has begun to ease across many states, people are <em>still</em> spending an astounding amount of time browsing the web for local content/products/services.</p>



<p>If you’ve been overlooking the importance of digitalizing your business, you may want to jump on the bandwagon. And while adopting digitalization is a great way to get started, it’s not enough.</p>



<p>According to Forbes, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2017/08/30/how-to-optimize-your-seo-results-through-content-creation/#259f710b2aa3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">75%</a> of internet users never scroll past the first SERP (search engine result page).</p>



<p>If your content isn’t optimized, engaging, and gripping, it’s most likely to show up on the 12<sup>th</sup>, 13<sup>th</sup> or even 40<sup>th</sup> SERP. With an average attention span of <a href="https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">eight seconds</a>, people barely glance over the first page, let alone scour the remaining SERPs—so you better get optimizing.</p>



<p>What do you do to stand out from the crowd and make a stellar first impression?</p>



<p>It’s simple. You optimize your content for the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p><em>Sounds odd, doesn’t it?</em></p>



<p>We’ll help break things down so you can leverage the 3-Pack to rank locally on Google.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in!</p>



<h2>What is the Local SEO 3-Pack?</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1647" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Simply put, the Google 3-Pack is a listing of the top three search results for a local search.</p>



<p>While a regular search doesn’t include geographic keywords, a local search commonly includes the phrases “near me,” “close to me,” or “in [location].”</p>



<p>For instance, if you search for “Italian restaurants in Manhattan,” you’ll receive the following Google 3-Pack:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1648" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Similarly, if you search for “barbershop in Downtown Los Angeles,” you’ll see the following Google 3-Pack:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1649" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Notice how the 3-Pack covers every base to give internet users comprehensive—albeit concise—information about the most relevant, popular, and reputable local search results.</p>



<p>With a simple search, people can instantly access the following information about the top three businesses:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Introductory image</li>
<li>Map with personalized directions</li>
<li>Link to website</li>
<li>Rating</li>
<li>Number of reviews</li>
<li>Timings</li>
<li>Key features (e.g. dine-in, delivery, curbside pickup, etc.)</li>
</ul>



<p>If they choose to engage with the listing, they can view even more details, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Additional images</li>
<li>FAQs</li>
<li>Popular times</li>
<li>Detailed critic reviews and testimonials</li>
<li>Amenities</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Booking options</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, the Google 3-Pack is an efficient, accurate, and time-saving gold mine for local searchers.</p>



<p>Over the years, Google reduced the number of topmost local searches from seven to five. In 2015, the pack was further condensed by reducing five listings to three for enhanced convenience, ease, and relevance.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that the search results on the first page of Google generate a whopping <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/10/30/the-value-of-search-results-rankings/#38f75a0744d3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">92%</a> of organic traffic. In fact, the first result in the Google 3-Pack enjoys an enviable <a href="https://www.tytonmedia.com/blog/seo-statistics/#:~:text=Position%20%231%20in%20google%20enjoys%20a%2034.36%25%20CTR.&amp;text=On%20average%2C%20Google%20receives%20over,a%20video%20on%20your%20homepage." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">34.36%</a> CTR (click-through rate).</p>



<p>Customers are less likely to engage with results that show up underneath the Google 3-Pack. While search results on the first page that fall outside the 3-Pack still generate a lot of traffic, the second, third, and subsequent pages suffer from diminishing traffic generation.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1650" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>That’s why we’ve rounded up some of the most effective and whip-smart SEO strategies to help your business <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/get-ranked-high-in-2020-6-proven-seo-strategies-for-small-businesses-and-startups/">rank higher on Google Maps</a>, so it can show up on the coveted Google 3-Pack.</p>



<h2>How to Optimize for the Google 3-Pack?</h2>



<h3>1. Check Where You Currently Stand</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1651" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>It should come as no surprise that the Google 3-Pack appears <a href="https://www.seoclarity.net/how-googles-local-pack-update-has-reshaped-the-organic-landscape-12952/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">93%</a> of the time when people run a local search.</p>



<p>If you run a local business, optimizing your content to <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/getting-local-consumer-traction-by-ranking-up-on-google-maps-a-breakdown/">rank locally on Google</a> is essential. And checking where your business currently stands is a great way to kick things off.</p>



<p>While you may feel compelled to dive into the deep end of 3-Pack optimization, forgoing prior research could end up doing more harm than good.</p>



<p>Instead, we suggest consulting with SEO experts to determine whether your business appears in the top 20 local search results. This will help streamline and refine the optimization strategy for your business.</p>



<h3>2. Claim, Fill, and Optimize Your Google My Business Listing</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1652" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Leveraging Google My Business is one of the most effective ways to rank higher on Google Maps.</p>



<p>As Google’s own in-house platform, Google My Business makes it much easier for customers to find, access, and engage with your business.</p>



<p>If you haven’t claimed your free listing yet, we suggest tackling that task first by clicking <a href="https://business.google.com/create?gmbsrc=ww-ww-et-gs-z-gmb-v-z-h~bhc-core-u%7Cmybb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">here</a>. Simply enter your company’s name or add your business to Google if it isn’t already in the directory.</p>



<p>Once you’ve claimed your listing, take your time to fill out the required information. Take special care to ensure accuracy and relevance, as this information will potentially appear in the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p>You’ll be requested to share your company’s:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Website URL</li>
<li>Industry category</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Business hours</li>
<li>Types of payment accepted</li>
<li>Description</li>
</ul>



<p>The more information you provide, the greater your chances of showing up on the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p>Ensure NAP (name, address, phone number) consistency to lend legitimacy and credibility to your business. Any deviations could reduce the authority of your business and prevent customers from accessing information or finding your listing altogether.</p>



<p>Once you’ve filled in the relevant information, the <em>real work</em> begins.</p>



<p>Optimizing and updating your listing are two of the most impactful ways to help your business climb SERPs.</p>



<p>Share high-resolution images and upload photos on a weekly basis to ensure relevance and keep your audience engaged. According to Google, businesses with photos enjoy <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6335804?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">42%</a> more requests for directions to their location and <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6335804?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">35%</a> more clicks to their website.</p>



<p>Cover different areas of your business, including the storefront and variegated interior angles.</p>



<p>Make sure important details like the hours of operation are up to date. Maximizing relevance will go a long way in improving the visitor-to-lead conversion rate.</p>



<p>We suggest browsing through our earlier blog titled “<a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/how-to-optimize-google-my-business-listing-and-leverage-it-for-more-sales/">How to Optimize Google My Business Listing and Leverage It for More Sales</a>” for more insights.</p>



<h3>3. Master the Art of On-Page SEO to Rank Locally on Google</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1653" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Neglecting on-page SEO is one of the most common mistakes that land small-scale local businesses in hot water.</p>



<p>Google uses over <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">200</a> unique factors in their algorithm to rank websites. Creating a strong <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/8-ways-to-adjust-your-seo-strategy-amid-the-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic/">on-page SEO strategy</a> can easily help you check most of these off your list!</p>



<p>For example, most small business owners don’t know that they can increase their chances of appearing in Google 3-Pack by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/05/14/speed-matters-how-your-websites-page-speed-can-affect-your-marketing-efforts/#7cc9f7bc1cbc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">improving their website’s loading time.</a></p>



<p>According to a recent study, pages that load quickly rank <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">significantly higher</a> on SERPs. In fact, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">79%</a> of customers who have trouble with a website’s loading time admit that they won’t return to the site in the future.</p>



<p>Here are some easy strategies to help speed up your website:</p>



<ul>
<li>Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML</li>
<li>Minimize HTTP requests</li>
<li>Reduce server response time</li>
<li>Opt for the right host (shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated server)</li>
<li>Enable browser caching</li>
<li>Compress images and optimize files</li>
<li>Use a CDN (content delivery network)</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, optimize your content by using relevant keywords, title tags, meta description, headlines, header tags, short descriptive URLs, and alt text.</p>



<p>These strategies will go a long way in helping your business rank higher on Google Maps.</p>



<h3>4. Attract a Plethora of High-Quality, Positive Reviews for Your Business</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1654" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>While leveraging reviews may sound like one of the least actionable strategies to help your business show up on the Google 3-Pack, it’s surreptitiously one of the most effective.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, Google loves reviews.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because customers trust them and heavily rely on them!</p>



<p>If your business has a high number of positive reviews, you’ll earn a great ranking on Google My Business. This ranking, in turn, will help you climb up SERPs and earn a spot in the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p>Remember, Google is constantly vetting relevant businesses to find the most reputable options that help customers have a great experience.</p>



<p>If your business has a poor ranking of 2.6/5, for example, the chances are that you’ll get stuck in the back end of SERPs.</p>



<p>Turn that around by boosting your ranking and you’ll instantly maximize your chances of showing up in the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<p>But how do you go about this?</p>



<p>By requesting reviews.</p>



<p>According to a recent survey, over <u><a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/learn/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">97%</a></u> of customers engage with online reviews for local businesses. While customers prioritize <em>reading</em> reviews, they also understand the importance of <em>offering</em> reviews.</p>



<p>Here are some ways you can earn quality reviews for your business:</p>



<ul>
<li>Send a courteous and engaging email to customers, requesting a review for products/services they recently used. Opting for a personalized approach will increase your chances of receiving a timely and positive review.</li>
<li>Create a “Review Us” page on your website. When customers interact with the link, they should be redirected to your Google Review URL. This is a great way to ensure the reviews increase your chances of taking a spot in Google’s 3-Pack.</li>
<li>Use a <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/genius-qr-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">QR code</a> creatively to redirect customers to your Google Review page. Click <a href="http://qrcode.kaywa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">here</a> to generate a QR code using a free tool.</li>
</ul>



<h3>5. Create Engaging, Unique, and Value-Added Local Content</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1658" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>Creating <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/why-content-driven-seo-is-the-ultimate-digital-marketing-strategy-for-2020/">local content</a> and tweaking product/service pages by incorporating local keywords is a powerful way to rank locally on Google.</p>



<p>We suggest using <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwj4jIeLjPfpAhVY4O0KHfzGAkMYABAAGgJkZw&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESQeD2ATTCDwsi9a7HZ3WrhcMTxqXpTvZ9vJunG7hMQumlK3VOrvZ82FJ9EkDGSGMyMYYehtCcNuWFrCzXfd2VxHUH&amp;sig=AOD64_2DpKVa8oZTxeOwZCFOFuRj1R1fCQ&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5lf-KjPfpAhWJQkEAHTbzA38Q0Qx6BAgPEAE&amp;adurl=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">Google Keyword Planner</a> or getting in touch with SEO experts to identify and effectively use local keywords.</p>



<p>In addition, create content around local events, holidays, news, and trending topics to ensure you reach a wide local audience. Optimizing your content for local search will ultimately help your business rank higher and tap into diverse local demographics.</p>



<p>Of course, don’t lose sight of ensuring that the content is engaging, informative, and compelling. No matter how well your local SEO strategy may be, producing subpar content that doesn’t strike a chord with your target audience will take you back to square one.</p>



<p>Instead, fuse quality with local SEO to create and execute a winning content marketing strategy.</p>



<p>We suggest focusing on creating high-quality and optimized:</p>

</ul>



<h3>6. Claim External Review Sites</h3>



<p>Popular external review sites like Yelp, Foursquare, Tripadvisor, Trustpilot, and Yellowpages are vital sources of traffic for your business. Each review on an external review site signals to Google to boost SERP rankings for your business.</p>



<p>We recommend browsing through each platform’s specific review guidelines to ensure compliance.</p>



<p>Once the reviews start pouring in, you’ll notice an increase in audience engagement and retention. Consistent positive reviews will help your business climb SERPs and earn a spot on the Google 3-Pack.</p>



<h3>7. Earn Local Backlinks From Websites With High Domain Authority</h3>



<p>Link building is undeniably one of the most effective ways to get your business on the map.</p>



<p>Simply put, link building is the process of acquiring backlinks from third-party websites.</p>



<p>For instance, if a non-competitor in your industry links to your content or product/service pages, you earn a backlink.</p>



<p>Why is this important?</p>



<p>Earning a valuable backlink from a website with a <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/high-domain-authority/">high domain authority</a> is a surefire way to attract quality traffic. As their readers are redirected to your content, you’ll successfully manage to tap into a wide audience base.</p>



<p>While this means more revenue, it also means higher chances of breaking into the Google 3-Pack in the long run!</p>



<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/10-advanced-link-building-tips-and-tricks-to-boost-your-seo/">advanced link building tips and tricks</a> to help you get started!</p>



<h3>8. Create a Mobile-Friendly Website</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1659" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-seo-stats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)">78%</a> of all local mobile searches result in a purchase. As smartphones become the epicenter of the modern world, creating a mobile-friendly website is imperative.</p>



<p>If your website isn’t <a href="https://www.searchberg.com/responsive-mobile-design/">mobile-friendly</a>, you’ll fail to target the large majority of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X customers.</p>



<p>We suggest opting for clean yet appealing graphics, user-friendliness, and eye-catching CTAs (call-to-actions).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-1660" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/14.png" alt="" /></figure>
</div>



<p>In fact, mobile-friendliness also helps Google determine the quality and legitimacy of your business. If your website isn’t mobile-friendly, there’s no reason for Google to include it in the 3-Pack. The last thing Google wants is to receive negative feedback from customers who interacted with a business in the 3-Pack that didn’t have a mobile-friendly website.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1448" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/top-view-business-people-meeting_23-2148427084.jpg" alt="importance of Google My Business" width="626" height="414" /></p>
<p>While you may have developed an excellent marketing strategy with a strong focus on social media optimization and diverse marketing, overlooking the importance of optimizing your <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google My Business</a></strong> listing is a big faux pas that could cause your metrics to plummet.</p>
<p>So what exactly<em> is</em> Google My Business?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a free online tool for organizations and businesses to help them manage their online presence through Google, among Google properties such as Google Maps and Google Search.</p>
<p>Basically, it helps customers find your business and helps you tell them your business&#8217;s story. To make your listing more legitimate, you can even verify your Google My Business listing.</p>
<p>With over <u><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">90%</a></u> of Americans owning a cell phone, tapping into the depths of online directories has become one of the easiest ways to boost audience reach, engagement, and retention.</p>
<p>Let’s look at it this way:</p>
<p>Are you constantly on the lookout for new restaurants to try with your beau or family?</p>
<p>Do you jump at the thought of stumbling upon unique tech-savvy products that make your life easier?</p>
<p>Does the thought of coming across an affordable and trendy local online clothing store make you grin from ear to ear?</p>
<p>If you answered at least one of these questions in the affirmative, <em>Google My Business</em> has already impacted your life for the better.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever sought out a business that can help you meet your needs on Google, Google My Business has helped you find that business.</p>
<p>Like you, the majority of American consumers are actively seeking modern solutions to their needs—both consciously and subconsciously.</p>
<p>And let’s face it—nobody wants to crank open the yellow pages to find businesses that offer their desired products or services.</p>
<p>This is where Google My Business steps in.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1449" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1548345680-f5475ea5df84.jpg" alt="This is where Google My Business steps in" width="752" height="500" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1458" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-popular-business.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="250" /></p>
<p>By creating a profile laden with operating information and engaging text, photo, and video posts, businesses can give customers exactly what they’re looking for—and more.</p>
<p>With over <u><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nearly-all-consumers-97-now-use-online-media-to-shop-locally-according-to-biakelsey-and-constat-87221242.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">97%</a></u> of U.S. consumers using online platforms to shop locally, Google My Business is the most popular and effective online tool for businesses to leverage in 2020.</p>
<p>But how do you kick things off?</p>
<h2>Start by creating a Google My Business Account To Optimize For Greater Brand Visibility</h2>
<p>Each <strong>month</strong>, <u><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google</a></u> receives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 5 million searches for <strong>restaurants</strong></li>
<li>Approximately 3 billion searches for <strong>hotels</strong></li>
<li>1 billion searches for <strong>clothing shops</strong></li>
<li>Close to 600 million searches for <strong>cosmetic salons</strong> (hair, nails, makeup, skincare, and more)</li>
<li>5 million searches for <strong>coffee shops</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As the most popular, efficient, and easy-to-use search platform across the globe, Google offers businesses a plethora of opportunities to make their presence felt among consumers.</p>
<p>So give your brand visibility by getting on the map!</p>
<p>You can <strong>claim your business</strong> by <strong><u>creating a Google My Business listing</u></strong>.</p>
<p>We also recommend <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO9OelOoWWA&amp;vl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">linking your profile to your Google Ads account</a></strong> to <em>increase engagement on</em> your ads. Once you’re done, your profile will show up whenever users run local search queries.</p>
<p>A study conducted by Google revealed that <u><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/914/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search_research-studies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">50%</a></u> of users who searched for a local business on their smartphone visited the store within a day. As you optimize your Google My Business profile, your business will begin to climb SERPs, thereby helping you reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>Despite this incredible advantage, over <u><a href="https://www.lsainsider.com/study-56-of-local-retailers-havent-claimed-google-my-business-listing/archives#sthash.T9wEaibB.dpbs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">56%</a></u> of local retailers haven’t claimed their free Google My Business listing. If your business is part of this percentage, it may be time to give your brand the boost it deserves by creating an <strong>engaging, informative, and creative listing</strong>.</p>
<p>Include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone Number</li>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Business Hours</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Types of Payment Accepted</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Frequently Asked Questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only will an updated and relevant online listing help your business attract new customers, but it’ll also enhance credibility, reputability, and authenticity.</p>
<p>This will allow you to <strong>retain old customers</strong> and <strong>solidify your customer base</strong>, thereby boosting business metrics.</p>
<p>We also recommend applying for verification to utilize all the tools available on the GMB dashboard and enhance visibility across Google Search and Maps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1456" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ensure-NAP-Consistency.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="250" /></p>
<p>Increase local traffic by ensuring<em> NAP</em> (Name, Address, and Phone Number) consistency across your Google My Business profile, website, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>The<strong> consistency </strong>will add an air of professionalism to your business while helping users find accurate information across all digital platforms.</p>
<p>For instance, if your number is listed without area codes or prefixes (e.g., 1-800)on your website, it’s essential that your Google My Business page follows the same format.</p>
<p><strong><u>Listing accuracy also establishes trust</u></strong>, making customers feel more inclined toward completing a transaction with certain businesses. Imagine opening a brand’s Google My Business page, only to be confronted with inconsistent information, informal writing, and slipshod uppercase and lowercase usage.</p>
<p>The <em>informality</em> is very likely to put you off and compel you to browse further until you find a competitor that may not have an equally impressive range of products but offers a seamless and professional Google My Business profile.</p>
<p>While these details may seem negligible, they have a transformative—albeit subconscious—effect on the <u><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/281126" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">consumer buying process</a></u>.</p>
<h2>Make Your Listing Stand Out From the Crowd by Using Local SEO Services for Optimization</h2>
<p>Struggling to <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/getting-local-consumer-traction-by-ranking-up-on-google-maps-a-breakdown/">get more traffic from local visitors</a></u>? It may be time to optimize your Google My Business account by recruiting help from <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/local-seo-services.html">local SEO services</a></u>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1450" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/searching-engine-optimizing-seo-browsing-concept_53876-64993.jpg" alt="recruiting help from local SEO services" width="626" height="589" /></p>
<p>Digital marketing companies are equipped with years of expertise and the latest insights into organic Google My Business optimization, social media marketing, and lead generation. Not only will their cutting-edge marketing strategies help you climb SERPs, but you’ll also notice an improvement in key performance indicators.</p>
<h2>Request Customer Reviews and Actively Respond to Them</h2>
<p>Research indicates that over <u><a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">91%</a></u> of potential consumers read online reviews. Out of this, approximately <u><a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">84%</a></u> trust this information.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that customer reviews are a great way to <u><a href="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/10-ways-to-build-a-strong-personal-reputation-for-individuals-and-entrepreneurs/">increase brand reputability</a></u> while doubling or tripling sales!</p>
<p>Leverage Google My Business by requesting reviews from your customers. You can do this by sending them a link via email or text. We also recommend actively responding to reviews—both positive and negative! Here’s how you could <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dangingiss/2018/08/27/4-simple-ways-to-respond-to-a-happy-customer-in-social-media/#23cbc66a3f5c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">express your gratitude</a></u> fora positive review:</p>
<p>Hi! Thank you for your feedback, [customer’s name]! We’re thrilled that you enjoyed our products/services. We look forward to delivering more quality products/services in the future and hope to see you again soon! It’s customers like you that keep us going. Hope you have a great day and continue to share your feedback with us in the future.</p>
<p>Not only will each customer feel individually appreciated, but they’ll also establish a virtual connection with the brand, thereby continuing to rely on their products/services. While you may feel compelled to leave negative reviews unanswered, responding to them in a diplomatic and reassuring manner is a great way to make things right.</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse of how you could go about it:</p>
<p>Hi, [customer’s name]! We’re so sorry our products/services didn’t meet your expectations. While our product/service is great for normal skin, it can irritate sensitive or eczematic skin. Our product/service is a great alternative that’ll recalibrate your skin’s pH while promoting a fresh and rejuvenating glow. If you’d like to return your product/service, please get in touch with our customer service team, and we’ll process a replacement or return right away! Keep us in the loop so we can suggest the best-suited products/services for your skin type and ensure you have a great experience this time around!</p>
<p>Tact? <strong><em>Check</em></strong>. Excellent customer service? <strong><em>Double check!</em></strong></p>
<p>Smart, empathetic, interactive, and remedial responses will <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanerskine/2018/12/31/how-to-respond-to-negative-reviews-including-examples/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">undo the damage</a></u> while highlighting positive Google My Business reviews. This practice will create healthy engagement on your page while making customers feel heard and properly tended to.</p>
<p>We recommend maintaining professionalism and courteousness to ensure customer satisfaction instead of driving away potential customers. When done right, <u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2019/11/06/customers-loyalty-small-business-responsive/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">healthy engagement</a></u> will increase local traffic and help consumers feel safe and assured about proceeding with a purchase.</p>
<h2>Make the Most of the Platform’s External Features</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1451" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1557426272-fc759fdf7a8d.jpg" alt="Leverage Google My Business" width="750" height="500" /></p>
<p>Leverage Google My Business to get your company on the radar by utilizing the platform’s external features. For instance, Google recently unveiled <u><a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/new-features-service-area-businesses-google-my-business/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new feature</a></u> for service area businesses.</p>
<p>By keeping an eye out for new developments, you’ll manage to boost metrics and increase local traffic.</p>
<p>In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in <u><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/9776543" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new announcement</a></u> that requests businesses to update their information—especially new hours of operations owing to the global quarantine.</p>
<p>This established the importance of visiting the <strong><a href="https://support.google.com/business/announcements/9244023?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official Google My Business update page</a></strong> for the latest developments so you can optimize your page while complying with the requirements.</p>
<h2>Create Engaging, Creative, and Compelling Posts That Leave a Lasting Impression</h2>
<p>Google My Business posts are easily <strong>one of the best ways to connect with your audience and increase sales</strong>. Post <em>engaging, creative, compelling, and original content </em>to <strong>captivate your audience</strong>. Not only will this help regular customers continue to return to your business, but it’ll also engage <strong>new customers</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, satisfied customers are very likely to <strong>indirectly promote your business</strong> to their friends and family through word of mouth. Whether you highlight a new clothing line with rich, high-quality images or showcase a recent launch or event with an engaging video, your page will garner more traction, thereby increasing local traffic and helping your business climb the SERP.</p>
<p>Google recently revealed that businesses with images receive <u><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6335804?hl=en#Share_photos" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">42%</a></u> more requests for directions to the outlet <em>and </em><u><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6335804?hl=en#Share_photos" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">35%</a></u> more clicks than brands with low-quality or no images.</p>
<p>We recommend uploading a <strong>captivating profile photo</strong> and <strong>cover photo</strong>. In addition, share powerful text, image, and video posts on a regular or semi-regular basis—including content that captures the storefront, interior aesthetic ambiance, products/services, and customers having a great time.</p>

<p>Whether you showcase business colleagues diving into a delectable brunch or capture a middle-aged couple treating themselves to a relaxing couples massage at your luxurious spa, you’ll manage to engage audiences and increase clicks!</p>
<p>Don’t forget to ask for <strong>photographing consent </strong><em>before</em> you embark on your photography adventure, though.</p>
<p>Hire a professional photographer to ensure heartwarming and exuberant images that make customers feel excited about trying your products/services! You can also share GIFs and make the most of Google My Business’ call-to-action button.</p>
<p>Strike the perfect balance between engaging a range of audiences. We recommend focusing on <strong>millennials</strong> because of their <strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/09/us-generations-technology-use/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">unparalleled technology use</a></strong><strong> </strong>compared to other generations.</p>
<h2>Regularly Visit and Update Your Page</h2>
<p>Thinking of creating a Google My Business account, only to abandon it within a few weeks? You may want to rethink that.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to leverage Google My Business is being consistent and investing a little bit of hard work that’s bound to go a long way. In addition, leaving your page unattended could prevent you from getting back to negative reviews and strengthen your brand identity.</p>
<p>Review your listing on a frequent basis to update information, share engaging posts, respond to customer reviews, and answer FAQs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1453" src="https://www.searchberg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/interracial-team-working-together_23-2148349935.jpg" alt="respond to customer reviews" width="626" height="417" /></p>
<p>By <strong>answering pending questions</strong> and <strong>interacting with your audience</strong>, Google will process your <strong><u>listing as operational</u></strong>, thereby helping it show up in <strong>search results</strong>.</p>
<p>We also recommend posting on a frequent basis as Google My Business posts disappear after seven days. To ensure interactivity with new customers who may not have engaged with previous posts, produce fresh, timely, and hyper-specific content.</p>
<h2>Write an Engaging and SEO-Friendly Description</h2>
<p>This helps improve your Google My Business rankings.</p>
<p>Imagine coming across your favorite home furnishing store only to be let down by a bleak description that offers little to no information. While your eclectic bohemian rug may have sparked joy, a drab description could be enough to leave a sour taste in your mouth that may alter your buying habits.</p>
<p>Customers are always seeking fresh, engaging, and invigorating content that informs them without making them doze off.</p>
<p>To attract audiences while boosting metrics, we recommend writing a <strong>witty, informative</strong>, <strong>and SEO-friendly description.</strong> Keep things short and fun to prevent consumers from losing interest—which is very likely since Microsoft revealed that the average attention span has dropped from <u><a href="https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">12 to 8 seconds</a></u>.</p>
<p>Incorporate keywords that online searchers actively use. Not only will this increase local traffic, but it’ll also help customers find <em>exactly</em> what they’re looking for. If your description largely diverts from your products/services, it’s very likely that customers will feel frustrated upon encountering information that doesn’t meet their search requirements. Moreover, your listing may not even qualify for the top searches by virtue of its irrelevance.</p>
<p>Keep your description snappy, exciting, and SEO-friendly to ensure it shows up on Google Maps and helps customers find your location.</p>
<p>In short, your description should abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>No URLs/links</li>
<li>Focus on <strong>how your business stands out</strong> from the competition</li>
<li><strong>Avoid keyword stuffing</strong> at all costs</li>
<li>Avoid adopting a <em>heavily promotional</em> tone</li>
<li>Including a <strong>phone number/email address</strong> is acceptable</li>
<li>Win customers over with <strong>ingenuity, wit, humor</strong>, and a <strong>concise</strong> yet <strong>compelling description</strong>!</li>
</ul>
