This is why SEO should be a vital factor in your web design and development processes as it can pave the way for long term results saving you from the hassle of a massive site overhaul, which is both tedious and expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Being a complete SEO solution provider, Search Berg has worked on hundreds of complex website and development projects over the last decade.

This is exactly what you want, as a startup or small business owner looking to establish your business on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>When a client comes to us for an SEO project, especially he has not got good results in his previous SEO campaigns, he has a lot of questions to ask such as the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is a SEO friendly website?<\/li>\n<li>How to design SEO friendly website?<\/li>\n<li>What is an SEO web design?<\/li>\n<li>What is SEO friendly HTML structure?<\/li>\n<li>How to produce SEO friendly HTML code?<\/li>\n<li>What is SEO friendly URL?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In today\u2019s post, we will talk about the design and development elements pertaining to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/category\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEO<\/a> you want to seriously consider for your website.<\/p>\n<h2>Design Perspective<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk designing SEO friendly website first.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/streaming.yayimages.com\/images\/photographer\/vetkit\/345c4d84b7bb95779d5e0227b42a756a\/website.jpg\" alt=\"SEO Website Design \" width=\"651\" height=\"401\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Top Level Navigation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When search engines visit a site, they visit every single page and every single link on that domain. How efficiently the site architecture is structured assists the search engine crawlers to properly index and rank your site for your target audience. Top level navigation is very important in designing for SEO. These are your most relevant pages that you want visitors to find easily when they visit your site.<\/p>\n<p>When creating a flat site structure, be sure to keep pages no deeper than 4 clicks from the homepage. The idea is for search engines to find the content with as few clicks as possible. Of course, this is not to discourage people from not creating subfolders and categories when there is a need for it. However if visitors have to click more than 4 times to get to the content they are looking for, chances are that you have over-optimized and done something wrong. The users should be able to find content with as few clicks as possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flat Design<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A flat site structure is visually appealing and creates a positive, professional image on the visitor to your website. This is the most commonly used SEO website design pattern today and also the most popular one. In fact, it is very likely that your competitors are already using it. The flat designs are easy on the eyes and flow smoothly as the users scroll down. It reduces clutter and keeps the content evenly spaced throughout. It is one of the most important factors about how to design website for SEO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Content Consideration<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People often confuse content with text on a page. That\u2019s not correct. Content expands beyond words and it can mean a great number of things. If you have a photography site that is full of thousands of images; that\u2019s content. If you are a video library showcasing videos on a variety of subjects, that\u2019s content to your visitors. Determine what kind of content or different types of content will go on your website and then create the design accordingly. This is will result in a more consistent user interface.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Responsive Design<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The gold standard for today\u2019s websites, not having a responsive design can singlehandedly lead to failure in today\u2019s competitive market. More and more people are using their smart phone and tablets to make purchases. Mobile searches are expected to overtime desktop search any year now. To make the case further, Google came out with <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobilegeddon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mobilegeddon<\/a> update essentially stating that sites not optimized for mobile will not be ranked higher in Google. These are all clear signs of the tide shifting from desktop PC and laptop to small phones, tablets and phablets. Your website\u2019s design should be \u201cresponsive\u201d enough to adjust to optimal viewing based on which device is used to view it. Devise-specific experiences will enable you to reach more people, and ultimately lead to more sales or conversions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flash and JavaScript<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is no denying that Flash and JS take responsive design and user experience to a higher level. However, the truth remains that even to this day, search engines have a hard time understanding them. A site heavily based on flash will never rank high for their target keywords because the search engines would not be able to reach it thoroughly and thus not indexed the site accordingly. This is not to discourage people from using Java Script or Flash, however, do it carefully and in order to improve your site\u2019s machine readability, use structured data on those pages.<\/p>\n<p>I hope I have answered to your question \u2018How can I make my website SEO friendly?\u2019 with as much details as you want. To have proper SEO results, remember that SEO and website design go hand in hand.<\/p>\n<h2>Developer Perspective<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/streaming.yayimages.com\/images\/photographer\/kbuntu\/69fbcac243539bf8a034259d8e7cffb1\/web-development.jpg\" alt=\"web development banner\" width=\"637\" height=\"411\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Web development is more straightforward than design as it is purely a matter of following guidelines or making a choice and then going with it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HTTP or HTTPS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For many it\u2019s an open and shut case to go with HTTPS especially since it is well known that Google uses that as a ranking factor. However, if you are not an e-commerce site or do not take online credit card payments, you can easily go for HTTP.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Site Speed<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Site Speed<\/a> is a very important ranking factor that is often forgotten or overlooked by people new to SEO. In hindsight it might seem acceptable if a site takes 7 seconds to load. However, for Google that constitutes a negative user experience which leads to lower rankings. People today need information at lightning speed. They will not wait more than 3 seconds to wait for a site to load.<\/p>\n<p>Avoid making the main home page of your website image heavy. If you must use images, make sure they are properly optimized for SEO. Oftentimes, developers are under immense pressure to complete the project that they overlook site speed issues that later on become a problem, both for the client and their customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TLD or Subfolders<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a very important development factor that must be addressed before any design or development phase can begin. Most businesses are interested in mainly having presence in multiple countries and target people that speak\/write different languages other than English.<\/p>\n<p>There are two approaches to this. Either you invest in regional domain or country level domain such .co.uk, or .com.au. This opens up new opportunities to target individual countries and their regions more closely. This approach does require more investment of time, money and resources, all of which will be needed to achieve and then maintain the same level of presence that of the original domain.<\/p>\n<p>The other approach entails the use of subfolders (i.e. mydomain.com\/uk). The good thing about this approach is that no alternate CMS is required. Subfolders can run from one platform or CMS so development costs and website\/server maintenance is much lower than that of using a new TLD approach.<\/p>\n<p>These are just a few important considerations to take into account as you take the first step towards SEO friendly website development.
