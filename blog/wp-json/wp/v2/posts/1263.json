Today\u2019s entrepreneurs have the advantageous possibility of advertising their business on search engines\u2014and it\u2019s called <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/guide\/what-is-seo\">Search Engine Optimization<\/a> (SEO).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\">SEO<\/a> is a crucial element of any digital marketing for any small business striving to succeed. Most people hop on Google whenever they\u2019re searching for a service or product. If your website is ranking on the first pages for these targeted search terms, then your chances of improving web traffic, enhancing customer interaction and securing a conversion increases tremendously.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s post, we\u2019re going to be talking about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/the-2019-seo-roadmap-for-small-businesses-that-every-startup-or-company-should-use-if-they-want-to-rank-high-in-google-and-get-new-clients\/\">Small Business SEO tips<\/a> that collectively play a pivotal role in bringing about these conversion. As one of the leading <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/small-business-seo.html\">Small Business SEO agency<\/a> in the United States, we have put together 20 tips that you must incorporate in your SEO campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Make sure your web copies are written for humans<\/h2>\n<p>Search engines are much smarter than you think. They can tell apart an organic sentence, link, and paragraph from forced ones. Don\u2019t make the mistake of stuffing keywords on your website or keep talking about the same topics. It\u2019s never worked before, and it won\u2019t work for you any time soon.<\/p>\n<h2>2.\u00a0Narrow down your keyword list to use for your entire website<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no SEO without keywords. However, you don\u2019t guarantee any visibility for search terms if you\u2019ve got pretty much every keyword stuffed into the mix. The aim is to develop ownership for a particular set of keywords, so if anyone looks it up, you\u2019re the first result they get.<\/p>\n<h2>3.\u00a0Use Keyword Rich URLs for Landing Pages<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to know how to make domain names that are rich in the right keywords you can simply Google the results for your choice of keywords. For example, if your business sells men\u2019s shoes then your folder and domain pages should clearly mention these two terms something like this:\u00a0 <em>http:\/\/www.yourdomainname.com\/mens-shoes\/mens-shoes-foldername.html.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>4.\u00a0Don\u2019t Go Overboard with Keyword Density<\/h2>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, the total number of keywords and related phrases that you have on your page should be somewhere <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shoutmeloud.com\/keyword-density-seo.html\">between 3 and 6 percent<\/a> of the total written content and links on a page. This rule goes beyond your homepage. Indeed, from an SEO point of view, it makes up nearly half of your search criterion but it\u2019s important to have the rest of your pages contribute to the rankings too. For this, you\u2019ll need to ensure that there\u2019s a certain theme that\u2019s being followed across all pages because the more of them are ranked, the greater are your website\u2019s chances of climbing up the SEO ranks.<\/p>\n<h2>5.\u00a0Titles are Entitled To Be Different For Each Page<\/h2>\n<p>Switch up your keyword phrases and mix up their combinations in a way that the first few words in your title are SEO-friendly. Also, try to keep all phrases under 70 characters.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Insert a Unique\u00a0Meta Description\u00a0For Each Page<\/h2>\n<p>Any time you look up a phrase on a search engine you\u2019ll notice a small piece of text accompanying every title. That\u2019s a Meta description. It\u2019s like a summary of your webpage but it\u2019s also a very convincing call to action. For example:\u201cBuy stylish shoes for men today! We offer free shipping for all locally made shoes. For more information give us a call at 123 45.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Try to keep the Meta description under 150 characters.<\/p>\n<h2>7.\u00a0Don\u2019t Forget to Style Your Keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Keyword styles can really change the game. You need the search engines to pick up your keywords as organically as possible. For this purpose, using bold or italic fonts and header tags are crucial. If you\u2019re not sure how to go about this one, try some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geeksforgeeks.org\/types-of-css-cascading-style-sheet\/\">Cascading Style Sheets<\/a> (CSS) to match the layout and format with that of your website.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1268\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2.png\" alt=\"Style Your Keywords\" width=\"628\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>8.\u00a0Add ALT Tags Your Images<\/h2>\n<p>Whenever you\u2019re naming your images, remember to insert your keywords and related phrases into the Alt tags as well. The contextual reference provided by Alt tags can really help pull your pages up the rankings.<\/p>\n<h2>9.\u00a0Smart inter-linking is Intelligent interlinking<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve seen plenty of websites use internal links but very few of them do it right. Any time you have the opportunity to insert keywords to your webpages\u2014do it! Again, specificity in links is important.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Create an XML Sitemap<\/h2>\n<p>When your internal linking game is weak, it helps to have an XML sitemap that leads Google through all the most important pages on your website. In fact, all search engines love an XML site map.<\/p>\n<p>This brings us to the next point.<\/p>\n<h2>11.\u00a0A Simple, Straightforward robots.txt File Is The Way to Go<\/h2>\n<p>These are files that can be considered a web crawler\u2019s best friend. They tell search engines all the important details on what pages are allowed to be shown on their index. Now here\u2019s a neat SEO trick; insert your XML sitemap location onto the robot TXT file so you don\u2019t have to provide details to search engines on all URLs\u2014now they can find it automatically!<\/p>\n<h2>12.\u00a0Your Website Must Have external links<\/h2>\n<p>SEO-friendly websites are those that aren\u2019t afraid to link other related websites. The impact is greater when you\u2019re linking to businesses and groups that are local\u2014not just in terms of the city or state but also in terms of being in the same industry. Also, don\u2019t forget to use keywords with all your external links!<\/p>\n<h2>13.\u00a0Update Your Website With New Content Frequently<\/h2>\n<p>Of every SEO tip that we\u2019ve mentioned here so far, we have a feeling that you\u2019re probably worried the most about new content. Where do you get all that new information?<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll help you! We\u2019ve produced over 20,000 SEO projects and are still going strong! We can help you churn out relevant content and add new pages to your site so you\u2019re getting recommendations from others in your industry frequently.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1269\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/3.png\" alt=\"Update Your Website With New Content Frequently\" width=\"628\" height=\"460\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>14.\u00a0Make Sure You Are Getting Links from the Right People<\/h2>\n<p>You want to get links from all the popular websites in your industry. By popular, we mean the ones that rank on top. Make it a point to check the ranks of your chosen websites and ask them to link to you so you can link back to them. To make this effort more effective, give them a list of keywords that should go into the text. Emailing your peers can seem labor intensive but trust us; links from local industries can help your SEO ranking soar high in no time.<\/p>\n<h2>15.\u00a0Create a Linkable Page<\/h2>\n<p>When you want link-backs from visitors to your website, you need to make it as easy as possible for them to do the job. Create a page with your logos and keyword-laden text links and send them to your visitors, customers and subscribers.<\/p>\n<h2>16.\u00a0Broaden your SEO horizons<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t just stay cooped up in the corner of the SEO rankings with some trusty keywords and phrases. Make the online community feel your presence. You can do this by writing guest blogs for popular websites and industry leaders. You can also start your own blog and integrate with your website and social media pages. Perhaps, even submit some reviews or answer questions on <a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/\">chat forums<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/answers.yahoo.com\/\">online knowledge communities<\/a>. However, know when to stop because overdoing it can get you listed as a spammer.<\/p>\n<h2>17.\u00a0Get your website listed on various directories<\/h2>\n<p>Online directories have been with us for a long time and because of their high reputation search engines are likely to scan them for updated links. Note that some of these directories will require you to pay a small fee.However, the advantage of hiring a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/local-seo-services\/\">local SEO service firm<\/a> is that you can get access to directory lists for a fraction of the cost.<\/p>\n<h2>18.\u00a0Cement your online presence with a little creativity<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s tempting to chain down your content behind subscription fees and other exclusive membership programs but it helps to make a lot of your content available free of cost. Think of it this way, if you\u2019re posting about giveaways, discount codes, contest prizes, tutorials and other freebies people are more likely to link to you and pass on the information. It\u2019s a win-win situation for your small business!<\/p>\n<h2>19.\u00a0 Syndicate Your Press Release Documents<\/h2>\n<p>Press releases are a great way to boost your outreach and become visible to an audience beyond your target market. Any time you\u2019ve introduced a new service or have created a new product, it\u2019s time to send out a local or national press release.<\/p>\n<h2>20.\u00a0Get listed on\u00a0Google My Business<\/h2>\n<p>Getting listed on Google My Business or Google Places is a heavyweight move in the world of SEO marketing.This should improve your visibility for local searches and your small business should show up in the form of a Google Map too!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1270\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/4.png\" alt=\"Getting listed on Google My Business\" width=\"628\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Final Word<\/h2>\n<p>There is a science to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/small-business-seo\/\">SEO for Small Businesses<\/a> and it takes times to perfect.
