For instance, you could specifically target local companies when implementing your link building strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you offer interior design services. While targeting global and nationwide companies like Architectural Digest, Elle D\u00e9cor, and IKEA is a great way to get started, it\u2019s not enough.<\/p>\n<p>Give the strategy a local touch by adding more companies to the list\u2014<em>specifically companies that are based in Seattle<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that these businesses <strong><u>shouldn\u2019t<\/u><\/strong> be direct competitors. You can establish link building partnerships with businesses that sell interior doors or offer roof repair services in Seattle.
