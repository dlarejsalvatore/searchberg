While Word of Mouth Marketing remains the most effective form of promotion, it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s losing its influence to digital marketing as the years go by. In fact, many industries have seen this change coming and are taking the steps necessary to get ahead of the curve.<\/p>\n<p>Take dentistry for example. Where dentists had to rely on their technical prowess to steadily build their clientele in the past, these days, members of the noble profession can use <a href=\"http:\/\/searchberg.com\">Search Engine Optimization<\/a> to achieve exponential growth. This presents a golden opportunity for dentists looking to significantly increase their sphere of influence in a short period of time.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to do just that, here are a few steps you can take to add more patients to your clientele.<\/p>\n<h2>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Create and Maintain Your Website:<\/h2>\n<p>Ah, the first page of Google\u2019s search results. For most medical practices landing on the first page is something akin to reaching the Promised Land as it essentially means that their online platform is guaranteed thousands of monthly visitors. And if even a small fraction of them decide to opt for your services, then you\u2019ll considerably increase your clientele in no time.<\/p>\n<p>However, getting to the first page is easier said than done as there are countless checks and balances in place to ensure that only deserving platforms are marketed. In particular, Google will never promote your services unless you\u2019re constantly adding to your website.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, websites with little to no traffic are red-flagged and pushed to the back of the queue. To ensure that the same never happens to you, you need to constantly add informative blog posts to your website.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, all the content on your website needs to be unique as any plagiarized piece has the capability to do irreparable damage to your platform! If you find yourself in this boat or if you\u2019ve been the target of bad SEO by your direct rivals, opt for our <a href=\"http:\/\/searchberg.com\/reputation-management.html\">reputation management services<\/a> <em>pronto!<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adopt an Email Marketing Campaign:<\/h2>\n<p>Never underestimate the power of effective email marketing. While many \u201cexperts\u201d will have you believe that it\u2019s as ineffective as running your ads on a controversial web page, the fact remains that emails are an effective tool in your arsenal as far as digital marketing is concerned.<\/p>\n<p>The best thing about emails is that people can access them on the go. So, if your dental clinic is struggling to hold on to clients, send them an engaging email that highlights the strengths of your practice. A monthly newsletter can do wonders for customer engagement and can even substantially increase your profits.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, in order to ensure that you build a long-lasting relationship with your clients, the tone you adopt for the email is of the utmost importance. Generally speaking, you need to be informative without sounding patronizing \u2013 a thin line most businesses find impossible to walk.<\/p>\n<h2>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An Active Facebook Page:<\/h2>\n<p>Make no mistake about it; an active Facebook page is a sure-fire way to not just increase your clientele but also improve client engagement. Given the fact that the social media platform has more than <a href=\"https:\/\/gadgets.ndtv.com\/social-networking\/news\/facebook-profit-all-time-high-cambridge-analytica-scandal-maus-1842994'\">2.2 billion <em>active<\/em> monthly users<\/a>, it\u2019s of the utmost importance that you make your mark on Facebook if you want to add to your clientele.<\/p>\n<p>The best thing about Facebook is that it doesn\u2019t cost a dime to create a new account. That being said, there are many common practices that will ruin your chances of attracting new customers if you approach the platform without a meticulously thought-out game plan.<\/p>\n<p>A simple way of doing just that is by opting for our impeccable social media management services that will improve customer engagement. Our social media specialists are experts at digital promotion and can do wonders for your social media accounts. Whether it\u2019s more followers on Instagram you want or more likes on your Facebook page; we\u2019ve got you covered!<\/p>\n<h2>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Press Releases on Pressing Matters:<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to establish yourself as a leading authority on a pressing issue, a press release is one of the best ways to go about the process. When used correctly, a press release can paint your practice in a very professional light and firmly establish you as a respectable industry leader in your niche.<\/p>\n<p>Well-timed press releases are so effective that they\u2019ve catapulted countless websites from the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> or 4<sup>th<\/sup> page of Google\u2019s search results to the 1<sup>st<\/sup> page \u2013 a change so meteoric that it can change your fortunes and help you retain your clients while attracting new ones!<\/p>\n<h2>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s All In The Keywords:<\/h2>\n<p>As far as Search Engine Optimization goes, nothing matters more than using the right keywords. In particular, you should know the common concerns of your clients and potential patients, and should tailor the content on your website to include these words so that you rank higher when these people search for a particular product or service.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, you can\u2019t just add unrelated keywords to a blog and hope for the best as Google has a powerful algorithm in place to ensure that these words are used in the right context. For example, you cannot just add the phrase \u201cbest dental crowns\u201d to blog post that has nothing to do with crowns.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about particular keywords and how your platform ranks for these phrases as compared to your competitors, use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/dashboard.html\">Client Dashboard<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And that concludes our list of the best digital marketing techniques for dental clinics. If you\u2019re a dentist looking to unleash the power of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/seo-for-dentists.html\">SEO to grow your dental practice<\/a>, pick up the phone and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/contact-us.html\">get in touch with us<\/a>!
