Make Your Facebook Page Super Easy to Find!<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re going to start off with the easy stuff: people cannot find you if you\u2019re not easy to find! And we cannot emphasize this enough!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose a simple Facebook page name. Don\u2019t add unnecessary keywords.<\/li>\n<li>How to get more likes on your page using your blog? Add Facebook follow and Like buttons to your website or blog. This can direct traffic to your Facebook page.<\/li>\n<li>Embed a FB post on your website<\/li>\n<li>Promote your page on other channels like LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, and vice-versa.<\/li>\n<li>Create a promotional video promoting your Facebook page<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc52223227\"><\/a>2. Share Engaging, Data-Driven Content<\/h3>\n<p>Take a quick guess at how many images are uploaded on Facebook every day.<\/p>\n<p>100 million? Far off.<\/p>\n<p>200 million? Nope.<\/p>\n<p>300 million? You\u2019re in the right ballpark.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>350 million<\/u><\/strong>, to be precise.<\/p>\n<p>And this figure only covers image-based posts. You can only imagine how many text-based posts are shared on the mega platform each day!<\/p>\n<p>In short, there is an abundance of content on Facebook. If your posts are unengaging and lack value, they\u2019ll get a couple of likes at best.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cHow do I get more likes on my Facebook posts?\u201d Or \u201chow to get more likes on my Facebook business page?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You think outside the box. Sharing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/why-content-driven-seo-is-the-ultimate-digital-marketing-strategy-for-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">value-added, data-driven, and proven content<\/a> is a great way to compel your target audience to engage with your posts.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of adopting a generic Facebook content marketing approach, <strong><u>pull out all the stops<\/u><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Actively share value-added blogs, engaging infographics, conversion-focused videos, and other types of high-quality content to prompt action. You don\u2019t necessarily have to include media in your posts each time; you can also share text-based posts so long as they\u2019re brimming with value.<\/p>\n<p>Once you put your strategy to the test, keep a close eye on which posts are performing better than the others. This is a great way to replicate strategies that generate great results.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, you\u2019ll notice that Starbucks periodically shares inspiring stories from their customers.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a glimpse:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FStarbucks%2Fposts%2F10158353973898057&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=735&amp;appId\" width=\"552\" height=\"735\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FStarbucks%2Fposts%2F10158385056388057&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=552&amp;height=716&amp;appId\" width=\"552\" height=\"716\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>If you take a closer look at post engagement, you\u2019ll notice that each post has garnered 10K and 6.5K likes respectively. In fact, the posts have also earned a substantial number of comments and shares.<\/p>\n<p>This is a masterclass in reusing the same strategy because of impressive results.<\/p>\n<p>If certain posts outperform others, don\u2019t consider it an accomplishment and call it a day. Instead, consider it an accomplishment and actively work towards incorporating similar themes into upcoming posts to maintain high levels of engagement.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc52223228\"><\/a>3. Make Sure Your Facebook Profile Stands Out<\/h3>\n<p>While your Facebook posts may be engaging, if you\u2019ve let your Facebook page collect dust over the years, you may want to step back and re-strategize.<\/p>\n<p>An off-putting or outdated Facebook page is a recipe for disaster. As potential customers visit your page to engage with more posts, they\u2019re very likely to bounce if your cover photo doesn\u2019t look the part or your profile photo is pixelated.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, you may lose likes and notice a drop in conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can revamp your Facebook page.<\/p>\n<p>Start by focusing on the images. Engage customers by striking the perfect aesthetic balance between your profile photo and cover photo. We suggest keeping the profile photo simple, clean, and classic while leaving ample room for experimentation with your cover photo.<\/p>\n<p>HP\u2019s Facebook page is the embodiment of this delicate ratio:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2190 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/blog.png\" alt=\"HP\" width=\"931\" height=\"479\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you keep up with their page, you\u2019ll notice that they periodically change their cover photo to ensure relevance. This is a great way to add a unique touch of novelty to your page to prompt more likes.<\/p>\n<p>Use high-quality, creative, and aesthetically pleasing images to do the trick.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve taken care of the images, shift your focus to the \u201cAbout\u201d section. Keep it concise and engaging. Moreover, fill out each section to ensure comprehensiveness.<\/p>\n<p>Wayfair\u2019s succinct and feel-good \u201cAbout\u201d section checks off all the boxes:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2191\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/blog-1.png\" alt=\"about\" width=\"349\" height=\"496\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you get more likes on your Facebook page, your posts will reach a wide demographic.
