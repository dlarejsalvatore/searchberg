Your infographic needs to be bursting at the seams with credible data that\u2019s organized in a really helpful manner.<\/p>\n<p>The best players in the biz conduct their own research, but if you don\u2019t have access to that kind of data or the time to put it together, double down on the research process to put information together that people would otherwise have to spend hours to find on their own.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, there\u2019s no such thing as new information; every piece of media on the internet is a clever remix that people can\u2019t help but go back to.<\/p>\n<p>A few pro tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep the data current, so your infographic can remain in circulation for a long time.<\/li>\n<li>Present credible data, but make sure it doesn\u2019t overwhelm the reader.<\/li>\n<li>All the information should come together to tell a story.<\/li>\n<li>The more unique your content, the more likely third parties are to publish it (a prelude to guestographics).

Data storytelling is like an artform that helps you weave together your primary narrative and your data points together seamlessly, making your infographics so much more useful and easier to follow, all while leaving them jam-packed with value additive content.<\/p>\n<p>From a striking color palette and other visual elements to the content itself, every element interplays to create your story. Remember, humans are visual learners\u2014so <em><i>how <\/i><\/em>you present data to them often matters far more than the substance of the data itself\u2014that\u2019s just how the cookie crumbles.<\/p>\n<p>Need some more context? Check out these tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure the font and color scheme complement each other, and that the infographic sticks to them throughout.<\/li>\n<li>Even the use of charts and boxes needs to conform to the larger aesthetic.<\/li>\n<li>You can have different text in boxes for visual separation, but don\u2019t make it too much of a departure.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t crowd the infographic with too much information or too many visual elements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s a sample that does a really great job at all of the above metrics:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3154\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/POS-infographic.png\" alt=\"An infographic that has a clear narrative.\" width=\"461\" height=\"2129\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc71808552\"><\/a><b>3.\u00a0<\/b><strong><b>Publish Like a Pro<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Your work doesn\u2019t end when you\u2019re done crafting the perfect infographic. If you really want it to get you those oh-so-important backlinks with guestographics\/infographics, you need to perfect the publishing process, so people can easily link back to you, and so it\u2019s super shareable and discoverable.<\/p>\n<p>For let\u2019s talk about publishing on your own website, and we\u2019ll move to guestographics in the next section. Here\u2019s a breakdown:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make a new page on your website for the infographic, so there\u2019s a direct link to it.<\/li>\n<li>Add a write-up alongside the infographic that serves as both the description, and the SEO optimized text that will help you rank for the appropriate searches on SERPs (If you\u2019re posting it on other websites, change the write-up to match).<\/li>\n<li>Add embed code so publications can add your infographic to their webpage inline, all while guaranteeing that there\u2019s a direct route to your website.<\/li>\n<li>Add social share buttons on the page so your infographic gains more traction.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t forget to add a great call-to-action, telling readers to share your infographic\u2014it guarantees more conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you hit all of these metrics right, you can expect a ton of shares, and for your infographic to show up on Google Search and Image Search!<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc71808553\"><\/a><b>4.\u00a0<\/b><strong><b>Generating Backlinks With Guestographics<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As big of a deal we make of getting backlinks, here\u2019s something very few people will tell you. The formula for getting them isn\u2019t hard at all. It\u2019s as simple as taking a pinch of great content and adding the right kind of targeting outreach\u2014alongside a great value proposition.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe you\u2019re already emailing hundreds of people on the daily to get more links to your infographic on your website, or even to get it featured on another site or social media feed. But we reckon you\u2019re not getting a lot of link juice if you\u2019re reading this.<\/p>\n<p>If so, it\u2019s time to pay a lot more attention to the words <strong><b>targeted<\/b><\/strong>\u00a0and <strong><b>value proposition<\/b><\/strong>. You see, no one will want to feature your content if there\u2019s nothing in it for them; even if the infographic is great, you have to grease some palms before people actually engage with you. Remember, most major platforms are already getting hundreds of people reaching out every day. What makes you different?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take the example of this infographic on SEO:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3155\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/in-house-infographic.png\" alt=\"searchberg infographic on seo\" width=\"382\" height=\"2131\" \/><\/p>\n<p>How do you ensure a ton of backlinks for it; we\u2019re glad you asked:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start by finding platforms that post exclusively about SEO\u2014the more they\u2019ve already covered the better.<\/li>\n<li>Send them a <em><i>personalized<\/i><\/em>email where you refer to the editor by name, refer to already published content on their website, and then pitch your infographic as something that can augment their already great content (Pro-tip: Don\u2019t be too pushy, ask them if they\u2019d like to see it, don\u2019t always attach it first).<\/li>\n<li>But there\u2019s more! Alongside, offer them even more value by saying you\u2019ll write a mini guest post alongside; this really seals the deal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s the best part, Google doesn\u2019t always like links without surrounding text, but this method subverts that problem by adding a post around it. A win-win (Three times over!).<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc71808554\"><\/a><b>5.\u00a0<\/b><strong><b>The More Shareable the Better<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3156\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/social-platforms.png\" alt=\"social media platforms next to a phone with an infographic\" width=\"1121\" height=\"747\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a ton of ways to make your infographic easily shareable, and all of them involve reducing the friction (or the time it takes) for a reader to take your infographic and get it on either their social feeds or their blogs.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a neat example; there\u2019s a WordPress plugin called <a href=\"https:\/\/sumo.com\/app\/image-sharer\"><u>Image Sharer by Sumo<\/u><\/a>\u00a0that allows you to add floating social media buttons on all your infographics.

To know how to get backlinks, you <em><i>need <\/i><\/em>to know what types of backlinks you can get. This will help you target platforms more effectively, and optimize your content accordingly too!<\/p>\n<p>There are six primary types of backlinks you can get for infographics; here\u2019s what they are and what you need to know about them:<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc71808556\"><\/a>Links From Blog Comments<\/h3>\n<p>These backlinks come either from you or a reader posting the infographic link in the comments of other blogs that cover a similar topic to what your infographic covers.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019re a really high traffic driver because people love soliciting other people\u2019s opinions on content pieces they loved, so they\u2019re sure to peruse the comments at least once.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc71808557\"><\/a>Links From Topic Specific Forums<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, this also includes platforms like Reddit and Quora. People who look for specific answers to specific problems, or people who love a certain topic are very likely to click through to links that will help them.<\/p>\n<p>And yes, while most of these will be nofollow links, they will generate more traffic to your website.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc71808558\"><\/a>Links From Guestographics<\/h3>\n<p>We won\u2019t dwell on this because it\u2019s been covered above, but remember that you have an ulterior motive when writing your guest post; try to include an author bio section at the end so people know where the infographic came from.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc71808559\"><\/a>Links From Google Image Search<\/h3>\n<p>You can use Google Image Search to find out who\u2019s using your infographic without linking to it; once you identify these people, send out a mass email asking them nicely to add a link so you don\u2019t miss out on any quality backlinks.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc71808560\"><\/a>Directory Links<\/h3>\n<p>Again, we\u2019ve talked about this once above; it\u2019s a tried and tested way of getting links from sites that probably have a much bigger reach than yours.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc71808561\"><\/a>Editorial Links<\/h3>\n<p>This is your white whale, and just like Melville\u2019s <em><i>Moby Dick<\/i><\/em>, it\u2019s going to be a tough one to catch. You might have to invest in first-hand research, and you\u2019ll have to put your best foot forward for industry giants to use your infographics in their content. The payoff is more than worth it, though.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc71808562\"><\/a><b>7.\u00a0<\/b><strong><b>It\u2019s All in the Outreach<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Outreach isn\u2019t a monolith; it\u2019s every method you use to put your infographic out there. And you need to take an all-of-the-above approach when it comes to marketing.<\/p>\n<p>From leveraging all of your socials to the guestographics method described above, as well as regular email outreach to your existing subscribers, you need to fire on all cylinders. The best of the best have entire outreach times that are dedicated to finding link opportunities, while also optimizing infographics for organic SEO.<\/p>\n<p>And if you don\u2019t have the budget for that, reach out to the professionals!<\/p>\n<div class=\"blog-cta style3\">\n<h3>Want to ensure that your infographic has a sizable reach and brings in a ton of traffic?
