Identify Your Guest Blogging Goals<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to get started with guest blogging is knowing exactly where you stand.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, it could be one or a combination of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to increase visibility for your products\/services<\/li>\n<li>You want to position yourself as an authoritative voice in your industry<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019re looking to generate backlink opportunities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Analyze your business model and performance over the past few months\/years.

Look for High-Quality Guest Blogging Prospects<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have a set of well-defined guest blogging goals, you can start looking for the right opportunities for your business.<\/p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, here are some things to look for when choosing a guest blogging website:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>High DA<\/li>\n<li>Content that\u2019s relevant to your niche\/industry<\/li>\n<li>A wide audience that will be interested in your content and products\/services<\/li>\n<li>High-quality blogs with substantial engagement, i.e., likes, comments, shares, etc.<\/li>\n<li>A great reputation (no history of allegations, lawsuits, questionable content, inaccurate claims, etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Make sure you\u2019ve already checked your website\u2019s DA in advance.<\/p>\n<p>The score ranges from 0\u2013100; 40\u201350 is considered <strong>average<\/strong>, 50\u201360 is considered <strong>good<\/strong>, and 60+ is considered <strong>excellent<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>If your DA is less than 40, it goes without saying that you\u2019ll struggle to get a response from websites with exceptional DA.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pro-tip\">\n<div class=\"left\">\n<h3>Make sure you look for guest blogging<\/h3>\n<p>prospects with a domain rating that doesn\u2019t largely deviate from your score (a difference of 20\u201330 is acceptable).
