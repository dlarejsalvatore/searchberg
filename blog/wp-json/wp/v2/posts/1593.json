Maintain a Strong Online Presence to Build Quality Relationships<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Link building is quite simply the process of acquiring one-way hyperlinks (commonly known as \u201cbacklinks\u201d) from other websites to your own. Instead of waiting for established companies to naturally link to your page, you need to take charge and facilitate the process.<\/p>\n<p>Most brands either forgo link building strategies entirely or go overboard by overtly requesting links through excessive emails, social media messages, and calls.<\/p>\n<p>Opting for a strategy that falls on either end of the spectrum is a recipe for disaster.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, we recommend carefully navigating the link building landscape and creating a strong and balanced strategy. Building quality relationships in your industry through active\u2014albeit non-intrusive\u2014online networking is a great way to acquire quality links for your products\/services and web content.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1596\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/a-computer-screen-displaying-Facebook-messages-and-indicating-strong-business-networking.png\" alt=\"a computer screen displaying Facebook messages and indicating strong business networking\" width=\"624\" height=\"428\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Start by focusing on niche-related communities on social media and professional networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, join local link building groups like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/283822378314765\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Link Building Experts\u00a0on Facebook<\/a>. As you interact with business leaders in your community, you\u2019ll establish strong connections over time. This will organically increase your chances of receiving backlinks.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend actively participating in group activities by posting relevant comments, responding to questions, adding contextual value to conversations, and sharing insightful updates. These strategies will collectively place you on the virtual business networking map, thereby bolstering your chances of receiving backlinks.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1597\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/backlinks.png\" alt=\"backlinks\" width=\"624\" height=\"130\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>2.

This simple yet transformative switch will help you generate more traffic and acquire links from established companies with high domain authority.<\/p>\n<p>Ouai\u2019s frequent, informative, witty, and value-added blogs are a <em><i>great<\/i><\/em>\u00a0example of striking the perfect balance between quantity and quality:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1598\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/value-added-blogs.png\" alt=\"value-added blogs\" width=\"335\" height=\"709\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Their high-quality content and images, creativity, keyword usage, and posting frequency have helped them establish an impressive domain rating of 63, and they have secured approximately 18,000 backlinks.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a breakdown of the data acquired through the <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/backlink-checker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><u>Ahrefs Backlink Checker<\/u><\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1599\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Ahrefs-Backlink-Checker.png\" alt=\"Ahrefs Backlink Checker\" width=\"520\" height=\"105\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s vital to actively research relevant keywords and optimize anchor text accordingly to ensure your content climbs SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>We also suggest posting at least 2\u20135 long-form blogs or articles per month to increase your chances of receiving backlinks. Long-form content generally has a 2,000+ word count.<\/p>\n<p>You should ideally focus on creating different types of content, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Articles<\/li>\n<li>Blogs<\/li>\n<li>Press Releases<\/li>\n<li>Case Studies<\/li>\n<li>Infographics<\/li>\n<li>Instructographics<\/li>\n<li>Videos<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><u>Apple\u2019s informative and newsworthy press releases<\/u><\/a>\u00a0to incorporate similar content production tactics into your digital marketing strategy!<\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>3. Strike the Perfect Balance between Using Internal <\/b><\/strong><strong><em><b><i>and<\/i><\/b><\/em><\/strong><strong><b>\u00a0External Links<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>While using relevant and well-placed internal links is a powerful link building strategy, incorporating external links into the mix is <em><i>equally<\/i><\/em>\u00a0important.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, internal links are hyperlinks that direct readers to your products\/services or web pages. Alternatively, external links are hyperlinks that direct readers to external websites.<\/p>\n<p>While using external links may sound counter intuitive, it\u2019s a great way to encourage reputable websites to link back to your own content. Most companies receive notifications from Google Alerts\u00a0or BuzzSumo\u00a0each time a brand mentions or links to their products\/services or content. If you have similar domain authority, it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll receive a backlink or social share from the website.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, using reputable and informative external links helps your audience have an engaging and curated reading experience. This is a great way to boost SEO rankings by increasing audience engagement and retention.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, you\u2019ll notice an increase in monthly website traffic and a reduced bounce rate.<\/p>\n<p>Strike the perfect balance between using internal and external links to increase the overall quality of your content. A central deciding factor for whether a company will give you a backlink, quality will ultimately help you ride the waves of link building with ease and adroitness.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>4. Use Guest Blogging to Build Quality Links<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1600\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/a-computer-screen-displaying-a-guest-blog.png\" alt=\"a computer screen displaying a guest blog\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Writing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/guest-blogging-services\/\"><u>high-quality guest blogs<\/u><\/a>\u00a0for established companies within the same industry is one of the best link building tricks in the game. The tried-and-tested tactic works seamlessly by helping you tap into a new and wide audience base that would otherwise remain untargeted and unengaged.<\/p>\n<p>The process involves writing content for another company\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sounds ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the trick.<\/p>\n<p>While guest blogs are generally non-promotional in nature, they may include a few internal links to redirect readers to the host\u2019s website. This increases traffic\u00a0and enables the host to attract a new demographic.<\/p>\n<p>Guest blogs also include a concluding section entitled \u201cAbout the Author\u201d or \u201cGuest Article Written By.\u201d This includes anchor text that redirects readers to the hosting company.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/About-the-Author.png\" alt=\"About the Author\" width=\"576\" height=\"176\" \/><\/p>\n<p>High-quality guest blogs are more likely to compel readers to visit the host\u2019s website. If they like the content, they\u2019ll feel the need to keep up with that style, format, and type of content in the future.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re new to digital marketing, we strongly recommend browsing through our blog on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/5-benefits-of-guest-blogging-for-small-businesses-owners\/\"><u>benefits of guest blogging for small business owners<\/u><\/a>\u00a0for more insights.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>5. Keep Up With Backlinking Partners<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Most link building tools enable companies to monitor websites that give them backlinks. Leveraging these tools is essential to keep up with your backlinking partners.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend creating a list to track the brands that link to your products\/services or webpages. This is especially important because certain companies that were a source of reputable backlinks in the past may stop linking to your pages.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, it\u2019s imperative that you reach out to them with a polite email to determine why your site was dropped. This interaction can play a big role in reactivating backlinks and helping further business relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, familiarizing yourself with your company\u2019s backlinking partners is a great way to connect with them and return the favor, thereby concretizing the backlinking cycle.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, establishing a large number of active backlinking partners will help your business maintain a strong online presence, target quality traffic, build trust and credibility, and break into new markets.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>6. Become a Pro at Broken Link Building<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1602\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/a-graphic-design-displaying-a-computer-screen-and-a-webpage-with-multiple-links.png\" alt=\"a graphic design displaying a computer screen and a webpage with multiple links\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The broken link building strategy is undeniably one of the most powerful ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/the-art-of-linkbuilding-by-earning-links-through-content-in-2018-and-beyond\/\"><u>leverage link building<\/u><\/a>\u00a0and boost SEO. The process prevents readers from visiting broken webpages.<\/p>\n<p>Start off by reviewing your backlinking history.<\/p>\n<p>Compile a list of the times your website was referenced through anchor text but led to a dead link. Once you\u2019re done, reach out to the respective companies and request them to replace the broken link with an active link to similar content on your website.<\/p>\n<p>You may also create new content accordingly!<\/p>\n<p>This is a great way to reactivate dead links and boost website rankings. While it may sound like a lot of work, SEO experts can help you out by identifying each broken backlink and sharing accompanying metrics.<\/p>\n<p>This will help you determine which broken backlinks should be replaced on a priority basis. As the process is streamlined, you\u2019ll manage to optimize your backlinks and direct a wide audience to your content that would otherwise receive a 404 page and remain out of the loop.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>7. Convert Unlinked Mentions into Backlinks<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1603\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Convert-Unlinked-Mentions-into-Backlinks.png\" alt=\"Convert Unlinked Mentions into Backlinks\" width=\"624\" height=\"130\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In many cases, companies may mention your page without including a link. Not only is this a wasted opportunity, but it restricts a wide potential audience from interacting with your content.<\/p>\n<p>People are more likely to click on anchor text that directly takes them to the respective website. A mere mention, unfortunately, induces little to no action.<\/p>\n<p>We strongly recommend taking this step if a company with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/high-domain-authority\/\">high domain authority<\/a> and SEO ranking\u00a0mentions your brand.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>8. Submit Testimonials<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Testimonial link building is a great way for one company to build trust and credibility while the other receives a backlink.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win-win scenario any way you look at it!<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve used products\/services from a company in your industry, offer to submit testimonials in return for a backlink. This process also has a high approval rate compared to other link building strategies that may leave you in limbo as you await a response.<\/p>\n<p>The trick is drafting a professional, persuasive, and concise email that poses the request without sounding overbearing. If done right, you\u2019re more likely to receive a timely response and have your request processed.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend offering to send testimonials to reputable and established websites with high domain authority and organic search rankings. However, reserve this strategy for when you have the time to try the respective product\/service.<\/p>\n<p>Refrain from writing inaccurate and misleading testimonials.<\/p>\n<p>Done organically, you\u2019ll manage to submit numerous authentic testimonials and receive strong backlinks that you feel good about!<\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>9.

Start with keyword research to identify primary and secondary keyword phrases. Use the right file name, alt text, H1 tag, and meta description to help Google determine the content category.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, your infographic or instructographic should have a short loading time to reduce the bounce rate on the page. Use PageSpeed Insights\u00a0by Google to test the loading speed. PNGs, JPEGs, GIFs, and BMPs have the fastest loading times, so pick the right file format accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re done, share your infographic or instructographic on social media to increase visibility and the chance of acquiring high-quality backlinks.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>10.
