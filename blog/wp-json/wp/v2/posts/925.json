Then you are well aware of the challenges coming your way. Once you\u2019ve entered several different markets and created individual websites for them, a \u2018copy\/paste\u2019 of content from your original site to the international ones simply won\u2019t cut it.<\/p>\n<p>Developing a dynamic international SEO strategy is your key to unlocking global fame; no matter what the size of your company may be. Due to the ephemeral nature of Google\u2019s SEO requirements, it is <em>imperative<\/em> to be abreast with new information and adapt to local knowledge in order to truly hit the mark.<\/p>\n<p>Before you begin your plans for world domination, here are some ways to polish your strategy for best results.<\/p>\n<h3>Different regions \u2013 Different Demands<\/h3>\n<p>As a business catering to multiple regions, it is important to understand that what works in one place may not work in another, due to different audiences with vastly different perceptions and preferences. As Google provides SERPs modeled according to interests and trends prevalent in a specific region, your content, keywords and SERP layouts <strong>with have to change<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure your content is optimized according to the local standards. Translating content doesn\u2019t work; each region has its unique local vocabulary and cultural interests. Therefore, translated keywords may not be the ones searched for <em>at all<\/em> in a new region.<\/p>\n<h3>Create a Global Outline<\/h3>\n<p>While creating your international SEO strategy, the first step you must take into account is incorporating <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/189077?hl=en\">hreflang tags<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This tag is a code that lets Google know which region your content is made for. Have a hreflang tag means your content will be shown in the region whose audience it is intended for. Writing locally-specific content that appeals to the readers in a certain region helps provide a better user experience of your website and drives consumer interest.<\/p>\n<p>Having these tags also prevents being shunned by Google for producing duplicate content. Once Google, with the help of hreflang tags understands that your content\u2014that may be similar\u2014is for different audiences, you are good to go.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to add the hreflang tag in your content.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the tag in HTTP header and make sure it appears on every page.<\/li>\n<li>Add the tag in your location maps<\/li>\n<li>Mark up the content pages<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright \" src=\"http:\/\/streaming.yayimages.com\/images\/photographer\/stuartmiles\/ce30d1b3f621bd0b73b64f90df0e3243\/global-strategy-shows-vision-globally-and-planning.jpg\" width=\"376\" height=\"360\" \/>Localizing Content<\/h2>\n<p>Region-specific websites need region-specific content.<\/p>\n<p>Word-for-word translation will drown your SEO efforts. To appeal to the taste of different audiences, your content must be localized to their liking.<\/p>\n<p>If you want your content to resonate with an international audience, you must educate yourself with local insights and curate your content accordingly. Prior research at your end will include looking for search trends present in the region and then using those keywords and vernacular in your content.<\/p>\n<p>Create separate landing pages for each region you operate in and optimize them by adding local feature so as to enhance the look for your landing pages in the SERPs.<\/p>\n<h3>Blending Different Strategies<\/h3>\n<p>All great strategies are the perfect blend of several different ones and your global SEO strategy is no different. By combining local, mobile and international strategies, you boost your chances of producing a comprehensive strategy <em>that hits the mark<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to go about it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rate countries by their potential for prospective customers and identify your priorities.<\/li>\n<li>Use the global outline you initially created to make sure that search engines are aware of where your content is to be displayed.<\/li>\n<li>Then use your region-specific strategy to produce content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Working with a native writer and incorporating local keywords is integral to the performance of your content.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, ensure that your websites are mobile-friendly. With a <a href=\"http:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/platform-market-share\/desktop-mobile-tablet\/worldwide\">growing segment<\/a> of the population browsing the internet from their mobile phones, capitalize on the opportunity by making sure every page of your website is mobile-friendly!<\/p>\n<h3>Analyze Your Results<\/h3>\n<p>Once you are done with all the above-mentioned steps, it\u2019s time to measure your success. Use data from your analytics to understand what works and what doesn\u2019t, and tweak your strategy accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>To clearly measure your progress, keep a note of your presence in different locations before, during and after your strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, check the rankings of your pages to see if your hreflang tags and keywords are working.<\/p>\n<p>Your digital presence defines the reach and reputation of your business. When expanding to new markets, using these tips can help you create, not only a positive presence, but also a <strong>lasting one<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>Need Help with SEO?<\/h2>\n<p>Let <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/\">Search Berg<\/a> help your international SEO efforts by simplifying the process for you.
