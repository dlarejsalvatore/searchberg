And thanks to the technically complex search platforms of today, it has become more difficult than ever to please Google. We can spend the whole day ensuring anchor text diversity and analyzing keyword saturation, and it still won\u2019t be enough! So when it comes to SEO, it is a good idea to just sit back, relax and look at the bigger picture.<\/p>\n<p>Are SEO and search dead?<\/p>\n<p>No, far from it actually! Some may claim that they are dead or dying because they are nothing like they used to be a few years ago. Search engines can\u2019t be fooled with backhanded, black hat tactics. Instead they are becoming increasingly focused on discovering and catering to user intent. This intent is deduced by pinpointing user location, mobility, search history etc. It\u2019s a whole new world for SEO out there, and the only way your brand can be a part of it is with intuitive content that caters to user intent.<\/p>\n<h2>The Future Is Exciting\u2026 And Scary!<\/h2>\n<p>The last few years have been quite melodramatic. Google algorithms like Panda and Penguin have completely devastated sites that weren\u2019t ranking ethically. And still, evolution continues.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a business owner, looking to create a viable online marketing strategy for 2015, you should only be concerned about content creation. High quality, unique, plagiarism-free content lays the foundation for a great SEO experience that delivers great results, now and in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Some people say that social media will replace search. Yes, SMM is expanding exponentially. But it won\u2019t be replacing white hat SEO practices anytime soon\u2026 or ever!<\/p>\n<h2>But Search Is Not Dying\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>The problem is that people think SEO is only about manipulating and fooling the search engines into ranking a website higher. And now that it can\u2019t be done anymore, they think SEO is dead.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ready_start_call\">\n<div class=\"call_center\">\n<p><i>Ready to get started?

It takes a lot to rank higher these days, and it all starts with great content.<\/p>\n<p>Search traffic gives you the ability to target buyers, wherever they may be in the buying cycle. It ensures that your brand has a presence online when they come looking for info. And if you only use sponsored content to show up on search results, your customers will still trust the organics results more, or take their queries elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>SEO is not dead; in fact it\u2019s not going anywhere.
