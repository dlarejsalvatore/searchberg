We have a hunch that it has a lot to do with not revealing how their secret sauce algorithm works. Actually, let\u2019s append an \u2018s\u2019 to the end of algorithm.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1666\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Hummingbird.png\" alt=\"Hummingbird\" width=\"624\" height=\"130\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The one that\u2019s important to this article is Hummingbird. When it launched in 2013, it was hailed as groundbreaking in the way it leveraged machine learning. It allowed pages to rank even if they didn\u2019t contain the\u00a0<em>exact<\/em>\u00a0keyword that people were searching for, focusing instead on the\u00a0<em>intent\u00a0<\/em>of the user.<\/p>\n<p>It also penalized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/johnrampton\/2017\/01\/28\/seo-keyword-ratio-guide-how-to-not-kill-your-seo\/\" rel=\"\u201dnofollow\u201d\">keyword stuffing<\/a> and employed natural language processing capabilities to gain a rudimentary understanding of content quality.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, Google built Hummingbird from the ground up to ensure that all of a user\u2019s needs were satisfied when they search for a keyword. This includes related keywords, how in-depth the content is, and how a site serves other content that users may want.<\/p>\n<p>That being established, how do you go about making sure your content is as comprehensive as possible? We\u2019re glad you asked!<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc52786272\"><\/a>A Complete Guide to Content Comprehensiveness<\/h2>\n<p>Did you see what we did with this title? Not only is it a nifty alliteration, but it\u2019s also a great way to indicate to Google that this guide will give users everything they want.<\/p>\n<p>If we went with \u201c<em>A Guide to Content Comprehensiveness,<\/em>\u201d it would not only sound generic (and remember, Google\u00a0<em>loathes\u00a0<\/em>generic content), it would also suggest that it\u2019s just a basic guide, or that it doesn\u2019t cover everything a user may need to know.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2020\/02\/27\/15-best-practices-for-producing-quality-engaging-content\/\" rel=\"\u201dnofollow\u201d\">high-quality content<\/a>, according to Google, covers more than just the one keyword a searcher types in.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc52786273\"><\/a>User Intent<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s use an example to make sense of all this. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an aspiring academic, looking to write a paper on Postcolonial Studies. Your professor told you that a professor who goes by the name of Edward Said is the who\u2019s who of the field.<\/p>\n<p>When you search his name on Google, a bunch of results show up; in fact, let\u2019s take a look at what does crop up:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1667\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Edward-Said.png\" alt=\"Edward Said\" width=\"606\" height=\"342\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So,\u00a0<em>what kind\u00a0<\/em>of article did Google serve up?<\/p>\n<p>The first two results are both overviews of who Edward Said is and what his work was on. This is because Google knows that a user who was already familiar with his work would search something more specific.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t buy into almighty Google\u2019s omniscience?<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of another query we could have used:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1668\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Edward-Said-imperialism.png\" alt=\"Edward Said imperialism\" width=\"621\" height=\"439\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The difference here is that we searched for a specific\u00a0<em>concept\u00a0<\/em>that the author has talked about. This indicates to Google that you\u2019re more well versed with his work, and it provides us with both a link to his book and deep dives of him talking on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>This is what Google calls a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescommunicationscouncil\/2018\/07\/06\/how-to-leverage-user-intent-for-online-searches-in-your-seo-strategy\/\" rel=\"\u201dnofollow\u201d\">user\u2019s intent<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc52786274\"><\/a>In-Depth and Long-Form Content<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1669 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/long-form.png\" alt=\"an individual working on long-form content on a laptop\" width=\"535\" height=\"357\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s see what kind of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lehigh.edu\/~amsp\/2004\/09\/introduction-to-edward-said.html\" rel=\"\u201dnofollow\u201d\">content the first page<\/a>\u00a0provides.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing you\u2019ll notice is that it\u2019s a\u00a0<em>long\u00a0<\/em>article. That\u2019s a great place to start. Don\u2019t be afraid to churn out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/sachinkamdar\/2016\/02\/29\/the-benefits-of-long-form-content\/#545fc79dce64\" rel=\"\u201dnofollow\u201d\">long-form content<\/a> when it\u2019s required.<\/p>\n<p>If you cover all the bases in your blog or article, it\u2019ll <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/the-changing-seo-landscape-how-to-keep-up-with-content-marketing-tactics-in-2018-in-order-to-rank-your-content-high-and-ahead-of-your-competitors-for-your-target-audience\/\">rank a lot higher<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1670\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/blog-or-article.png\" alt=\"blog or article\" width=\"624\" height=\"130\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re focusing on guest blogging or writing engaging product descriptions, incorporating SEO into your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/seo-content-marketing.html\">content marketing strategy<\/a> will help your brand stand out from the crowd and climb SERPs.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc52786275\"><\/a>Subtopics and Question Mining<\/h2>\n<p>One of the things the first result Google serves for \u201c<em>postcolonial studies edward said<\/em>\u201d does is that it covers a broad range of topics a user may want to learn about after learning about this author. It talks about people he was writing in reaction to (Rudyard Kipling, etc.) and other authors that talk about similar themes (Malcolm X, Frantz Fanon, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>To Google, these are useful subtopics that not only make the page sound like an authority on the topic, but also give users a much broader spectrum to work with that will best serve their needs. These subtopics come from having a basic understanding of what questions a user might ask after reading a content piece.<\/p>\n<p>So how are you supposed to predict what are useful subtopics and questions?<\/p>\n<p>By using SEO keyword tools of course!<\/p>\n<p>Two free ones that are very useful are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/keywordseverywhere.com\/\" rel=\"\u201dnofollow\u201d\">Keywords Everywhere<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/\" rel=\"\u201dnofollow\u201d\">Answer the Public<\/a>. Both allow you query-specific keywords you want to be listed for, and provide you with related keywords, questions people who search for those keywords are asking for, as well as which ones you should prioritize based on search volume.<\/p>\n<p>If there are too many keywords, you can even use them as ideas for future content, to make your website a true one-stop for customers. This greatly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/get-ranked-high-in-2018-detailed-list-of-proven-seo-techniques\/\">increases rankings<\/a> as well.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc52786276\"><\/a>Trends and YMYL<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1671 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/trens.png\" alt=\"graphic design illustrating an individual producing high-quality and optimized web content on their laptop\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What else do you need to keep in mind?<\/p>\n<p>Well, there are also trends and YMYL content.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re looking to buy a 4K OLED TV, Google will hold articles that give advice regarding one to a much higher standard. This is because these types of articles actually influence people to spend money.<\/p>\n<p>YMYL stands for \u201cyour money, your life,\u201d and Google doesn\u2019t want to serve pages which will cause a customer any kind of financial loss. A good way to get ranked for such pages is to quote actual experts, or get a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/5-benefits-of-guest-blogging-for-small-businesses-owners\/\">guest post<\/a> written by someone who\u2019s an established name in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s a known fact that\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tomsguide.com\/us\/when-best-time-buy-tv,news-27059.html\" rel=\"\u201dnofollow\u201d\">TV sales skyrocket during the holiday season<\/a>. It\u2019s important to write specific content that\u2019s geared toward this trend.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you could feature a post on \u201cThe Best 4K OLED TV Deals This Holiday Season.\u201d This topic not only covers 4K OLED TVs, but also keeps the seasonality of buying trends in mind.<\/p>\n<p>To go back to the title of the article, it\u2019s comprehensive!<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc52786277\"><\/a>Content Comprehensives for SEO: How Should I Get Started?<\/h2>\n<p>As one of the leading content marketing agencies across the US, we\u2019re equipped with the resources and expertise to help you kick things off the right way.
