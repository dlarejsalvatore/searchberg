And that you\u2014as a business\u2014could\u00a0<em>leverage\u00a0<\/em>this page to effortlessly market your brand\u00a0<em>and strategically strengthen your online presence and visibility.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>They call it\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/bn\/insidesearch\/features\/search\/knowledge.html\">The Knowledge Graph<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913579\"><\/a>What is Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph?<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1698 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/2.jpg\" alt=\"graphic design displaying Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph\" width=\"626\" height=\"626\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The knowledge graph was introduced by Google back in 2012. It operates using semantic networks, or, more simply put, interconnected caches of data and information.<\/p>\n<p>The idea here was to make Google more efficient for users. Data is linked by way of both description and relationship. In other words, your searches show\u00a0<em>not just what you searched for<\/em>\u00a0but\u00a0<em>relevant and related information as well<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, the knowledge graph is the box that shows up on the right corner of your search page which contains information about a company, individual, service provider or anything\/anyone that Google recognizes as an entity.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1699\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1341\" height=\"570\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913580\"><\/a>Why Does Google Use It?<\/h2>\n<p>What this allows for is broader and more extensive searches when using the Google engine. Users are able to explore, find answers regardless of what they search for, and zero in on relevant information faster.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.techopedia.com\/definition\/21997\/semantic-network\">semantic database<\/a>\u00a0Google is continuously building is possibly the biggest in the world! The Google Knowledge Graph\u2019s capabilities include knowledge storage, representation, reasoning, engineering and learning.<\/p>\n<p>This being said, what does Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph have to do with businesses? How does the Google Knowledge Graph impact businesses?<\/p>\n<p>In order to understand this, we\u2019re going to begin by further dissecting the Google Knowledge Graph as well as related functions to better understand how to use Google Knowledge Graph for business.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913581\"><\/a>Industrial Relevance<\/h2>\n<p>There are two ways the Google Knowledge Graph is relevant to industries.<\/p>\n<p>One is the obvious availability of large amounts of information. This information is useful in determining user and customer behavior. This, in turn, allows industries to place and market themselves better.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1700 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/4.jpg\" alt=\"three phone screens displaying the online transaction process\" width=\"626\" height=\"417\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The second way in which the Google Knowledge Graph is relevant to industries is related to searching. It\u2019s a known fact that over 80% of traffic on websites originates and is directed from search engine results.<\/p>\n<p>A foundational understanding of how the knowledge graph works helps industries modify their websites and SEO in a manner that they are recognized as entities by Google. Needless to say, SEO is highly crucial for any business wishing to compete in today\u2019s competitive world. With T.V. and Radio advertising slowly reaching a point of redundancy, it stands to reason that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/the-2020-seo-roadmap-for-small-businesses\/\">SEO is a forerunner<\/a> when it comes to putting the word out about your business.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s now discuss how the Knowledge Graph is beneficial.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913582\"><\/a>Benefits of the Google Knowledge Graph<\/h2>\n<p>The Google Knowledge Graph is clearly a step in the right direction and is beneficial in a number of ways. Here are a few of the more relevant ones:<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913583\"><\/a>User Insight<\/h2>\n<p>Data accumulated is extremely useful in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/michaelrsolomon\/2020\/04\/13\/consumer-behavior-in-the-new-normal\/\">understanding and determining customer and consumer behavior<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913584\"><\/a>Relevant Searches<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1701 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/5.jpg\" alt=\"graphic design illustrating a local search and consequent transaction\" width=\"626\" height=\"525\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Semantic data organization allows searches to produce more relevant results and information. This makes it a lot simpler for those on the user end to locate sites hosting the services or products they desire among others.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913585\"><\/a>Efficiency<\/h2>\n<p>The use of meta-content and keyword relevance allows basic information to be provided immediately without users having to skip from website to website. They can simply scroll through search results till they locate what they need under the descriptions provided.<\/p>\n<div class=\"connections_img\"><a name=\"_Toc43913586\"><\/a><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1702\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"250\" \/><\/div>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913587\"><\/a>SEO Benefits<\/h2>\n<p>The Google Knowledge Graph benefits search engine optimization in a rather specific manner. It makes things easier for business owners and companies in two ways.<\/p>\n<p>Here they are:<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913588\"><\/a>Clear Optimizing<\/h2>\n<p>The Google Knowledge Graph acquires data and information from particular sources such as Wikipedia. This, in turn, allows companies, organizations, and business owners to moderate and influence information about them on such sources. As a result, they\u2019re able to put up the right information and hence present themselves better to potential users and clients.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><a name=\"_Toc43913589\"><\/a>Making Things Simple<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/7.jpg\" alt=\"graphic design illustrating an online search resulting in a transaction\" width=\"626\" height=\"473\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Algorithms in the past dictated that most companies had to have two websites. One for usable user information and the other for keyword-driven searches. Since the Google Knowledge Graph operates through interconnected information, it takes away the need for an additional keyword-driven webpage. This, in turn, reduces online clutter and halves the work needed to be done by companies and businesses to have their web pages <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/get-ranked-high-in-2020-6-proven-seo-strategies-for-small-businesses-and-startups\/\">show up on searches<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913590\"><\/a>Is It Useful for Small Businesses?<\/h2>\n<p>Regardless of how big or small your business may be, if understood and navigated correctly, the Google Knowledge Graph can work greatly to your advantage.<\/p>\n<p>One feature that should be understood here is the Google Knowledge Panel or Card. This little box or section contains highly relevant information pertaining to your business.<\/p>\n<p>It allows those interested to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find links to your main website<\/li>\n<li>Read customer reviews and access ratings<\/li>\n<li>Access your contact details if provided<\/li>\n<li>Access comprehensive and relevant information<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, it also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Makes searches user-friendly and efficient so more people can access your company<\/li>\n<li>Presents you as a primary or ideal option in searches<\/li>\n<li>Presents the company in a good light<\/li>\n<li>Gives potential customers and users a sense of legitimacy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913591\"><\/a>How to Create a Knowledge Card for Your Business<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1704\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/8.jpg\" alt=\"graphic design displaying Google analytics\" width=\"626\" height=\"416\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Though there is no way for any business big or small to reserve a Google knowledge card, there are steps that can be taken to ensure recognition by the Google Knowledge Graph system. Recognition also means that your business will likely show up when users search for products\/services you offer. For small businesses, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/local-seo-in-2019-heres-what-you-need-to-primarily-focus-on\/\">local SEO development<\/a> is key. We\u2019ll go over a few tips and pointers with regard to how to achieve this in the next section.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, however, knowledge graphs are auto generated. This is only done if the system picks up on an adequate online presence. The following tips are meant to help you give that presence a boost.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913592\"><\/a>Tips for Optimization and Recognition<\/h2>\n<p>Though there are numerous steps that can be taken to align your SEO with the Google Knowledge Graph parameters, we\u2019re going to focus on those we feel are most relevant.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913593\"><\/a>Schema Markups<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1705\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/9.jpg\" alt=\"schema markup on a computer screen\" width=\"459\" height=\"306\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/theyec\/2020\/04\/06\/striking-seo-gold-with-schema-markup-and-rich-snippets\/\">Schema Markups<\/a>, in layperson terms (well, almost), are known as HTML codes. Though these are not visible to everyday users performing searches, they\u2019re visible to programs such as search engines. Schema Markups help clarify what your company, organization or services are about on a data level. This clarification increases the likelihood of display generation in the Google Knowledge Graph.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913594\"><\/a>Wiki Entry<\/h2>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, Wikipedia is one of the main info feeds for the Google Knowledge Graph. Understand the pros and cons of creating a Wikipedia page for your company or business. If you feel it works, the creation of a Wikipedia page will greatly increase your presence. Just remember, any content on Wikipedia should be from a neutral standpoint.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913595\"><\/a>Wiki Data<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1706\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"250\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That being said, it can also be used by humans and is one of the main info feeds for the Google Knowledge Graph.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913596\"><\/a>Google My Business<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1707\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/11.jpg\" alt=\"graphic design illustrating an online purchase\" width=\"626\" height=\"626\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t already have a Google My Business page, it makes sense to go get one. As the most popular tool for businesses, Google My Business helps your business climb SERPs and attract high-quality local traffic.

We also mentioned how\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/local-seo-services.html\">local SEO<\/a>\u00a0was key for small businesses. Local listings are very much a part of that. Having your company, products, or services listed under certain categories increases relevance. This, in turn, increases the chance of your company or business showing up when relevant services and locations are looked up.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc43913598\"><\/a>Press Releases<\/h2>\n<p>If published by a reputed news site, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/press-release-writing\/\">press releases<\/a> are an extremely solid source of credibility. Further, they also help validate your business or company when looking to create a Wikipedia page.
