So today we will talk about the content marketing trends that will dominate 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Chances are that you will encounter the following phrases A LOT in year 2015 as the most effective content marketing trends.<\/p>\n<h3>1 \u2013 Content Generated by Other Users<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways of victorious content marketing is to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/search-berg-reviews-by-sitejabber-earn-it-the-prestigious-2017-customer-choice-award\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">win the trust of target audience<\/a>. For instance, a firm sends a message to its potential audience; if that audience has some or high degree of trust on the firm, they will follow the message. Now you may wonder how to build such a degree of trust, right? The best way to win their trust comes through the content generated by your existing users. It means that you put forth the content in front of your potential audience shared by other users instead of creating your own.<\/p>\n<h3>2 \u2013 Live Videos<\/h3>\n<p>Video content has already been a domination trends and it is has got stronger with live videos, the content viewers jump at. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2016\/03\/news-feed-fyi-taking-into-account-live-video-when-ranking-feed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook<\/a>, its users spend 3 times more in watching live videos as compared to other video content and their engagement in comments and likes is also higher. So ensure that you incorporate the live video as one of the most effective content marketing trends in 2015.<\/p>\n<h3>3 \u2013 Culture of Content<\/h3>\n<p>Content is no longer a lone part of your marketing department. If you are doing things right, content IS your marketing department! A culture of content within a company is an indication of its dedication to creating timely, original, enjoyable and engaging content by fostering an environment that is conducive to creativity. This will be the key to successful content <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/boost-your-organic-marketing-efforts-with-pay-per-click-advertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing<\/a> in the future.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/streaming.yayimages.com\/images\/photographer\/onephoto\/c06dae7489341d141c6315b57dc73ce6\/content-is-king.jpg\" alt=\"content marketing \" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4 \u2013 Snackable Content<\/h3>\n<p>With an attention span of 3 seconds, Goldfish only comes in second to human beings. Research suggests that it is nearly impossible to command the attention of adult humans for more than 2.8 seconds. Hence, the concept of snackable content or bite-sized pieces of information that can be consumed quickly, and still leave a deeper resonance is already in and will continue to be even more effective in 2015. Think of what\u2019s being shared on Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Now tell us if you have a strategy set up for creating snackable content for the coming year.<\/p>\n<h3>5 \u2013 Native Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Well, truthfully speaking, <a href=\"http:\/\/sharethrough.com\/nativeadvertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Native Advertising<\/a> is just another name for sponsored content. Native ads mimic organic content and are pretty handy when you want to build trust and engagement with prospective customers quickly, and are willing to pay for it. Think promoted tweets, suggested posts on Facebook, full page ads on Flipboard and so on. The native ads are more dependable, and therefore shared and clicked upon more than say, banner ads.<\/p>\n<h3>6\u2013 Augmented Reality<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2017\/03\/augmented-reality-is-already-improving-worker-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Augmented Reality<\/a> still seems to be a futuristic technology, but in 2017 we saw the growth in its use, especially by clothing stores. The experts are quite certain that its use will be more prevalent in the coming year.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/streaming.yayimages.com\/images\/photographer\/kentoh\/7befb806f26a38706e6f76cfc3b722e6\/augmented-reality.jpg\" alt=\"what is augmented reality\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7 \u2013 Snaps<\/h3>\n<p>This app has been in business for quite some time now, but it still has its effectiveness intact. If you are above 25 years of age, then we are pretty sure that you don\u2019t have the app it takes to \u2018snap\u2019! And if you are less than 25 years old, then in all probability you can\u2019t help but \u2018snap\u2019 all the time. The app is called SnapChat and everyone from Amazon, to Universal Pictures and McDonalds is using it as effective content marketing platform to target teens!<\/p>\n<h3>8 \u2013 Engagement<\/h3>\n<p>The next time you look at the Analytics for your page, don\u2019t panic if you don\u2019t see a respectable conversion rate because engagement can now be defined in many ways. Click-through rate, time-on-page, bounce rate are all examples. But measuring relationships is bit more difficult. It\u2019s a good idea to use track scrolling, mouse movements, highlighting, active window\/tab, and other factors.<\/p>\n<p>Are you ready to get started in content marketing with the most effective content marketing trends in 2015?
