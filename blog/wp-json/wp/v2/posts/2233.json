And if you\u2019ve made it big on social media, it goes without saying that your business has garnered <u>a lot of followers and attention<\/u>. This popularity in itself will hike up your webpages on SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>But if we take this organic correlation out of the picture, does Google\u2019s algorithm <em>actually<\/em> care about social signals when ranking webpages?<\/p>\n<p>Well, it does.<\/p>\n<p>Moz has conducted numerous studies (exhibit <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/does-google-use-facebook-shares-to-influence-search-rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">A<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/facebook-twitters-influence-google-search-rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">B<\/a>) to prove that Google does, indeed, use social signals to rank webpages. The increase in inbound links and citations plays a big role in making a business more visible on the web, which, in turn, improves rankings.<\/p>\n<p>Supercharge your social signals by creating social media pages if you haven\u2019t already.<\/p>\n<p>Start with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Over time, you can branch out into Pinterest, LinkedIn, and YouTube, if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve set up your pages, make sure you fill them out to a tee. Don\u2019t skip any important detail and make sure your business information (especially NAP\u2014name, address, and phone number) is consistent across the board.<\/p>\n<p><em>Now comes the fun part.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Optimize your pages by posting <em>actively and regularly<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t post for the sake of posting. If you share unengaging and lackluster content, you\u2019ll struggle to engage and retain customers. Instead, share compelling, value-added, and original posts to get people talking about your startup for all the right reasons.<\/p>\n<p>We also suggest sharing your blogs (and other types of content, if you have any) to send some link juice their way.<\/p>\n<p>Actively engage with your followers by responding to comments, messages, and tags.The more friendly, attentive, and empathetic you are, the better the chances of building a wide customer base.<\/p>\n<p>As a startup, <em>retention<\/em> should be one of your main focus. If a strategy strikes a chord with your audience, zone in on it to ensure customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>As you generate more traffic, increase conversions, and ensure audience retention, your startup will enjoy booming success!<\/p>\n<div class=\"blog-cta style2\">\n<div class=\"inner\">\n<h3>Grow your startup by building a wide audience!<\/h3>\n<p><a class=\"btn\" href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/free-proposal\/\">Request a free proposal and get started now!<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc56687713\"><\/a>Got It!
