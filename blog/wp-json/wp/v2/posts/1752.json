High-Quality Backlinks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1755\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/blog1.jpg\" alt=\"graphic design illustrating link building \" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a reason why the term \u201cbacklinks\u201d has become a household name in the SEO world. Whether you recently launched a startup or have been running a business for over a decade, leveraging backlinks is a surefire way to increase online visibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A backlink is an external hyperlink that redirects readers of a third-party website to your content (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/product-description-writing-services\/\">product pages<\/a>\/<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/service-page-writing-services\/\">services pages<\/a>\/<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog-writing-services\/\">blogs<\/a>\/<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/article-writing\/\">articles<\/a>, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, it\u2019s a goldmine for businesses that are struggling to appear on the first page of Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/a-marketers-guide-to-the-powerful-benefits-of-consistent-link-building\/\">acquiring backlinks<\/a> is commonly known as \u201clink building.\u201d Lucky for you, we have a video detailing just that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/GwiI6V1eyQg?feature=oembed\" width=\"770\" height=\"433\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds like the perfect way to ensure your business dominates search results, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there\u2019s a catch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While link building definitely plays a big role in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/get-ranked-high-in-2020-6-proven-seo-strategies-for-small-businesses-and-startups\/\">boosting SERP rankings<\/a>, it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all strategy that can be leveraged to produce the same results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many nuances that need to be mastered before you can sneak your way into the top search results on Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, you need to make sure that you\u2019re receiving backlinks from websites with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/high-domain-authority\/\">high domain authority<\/a>, i.e. stellar ranking on SERPs. The score ranges from 1\u2013100 and gives Google an idea of how reputable, trustworthy, and authoritative your website is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\u2019s algorithm works assiduously to analyze multiple on-page factors and determine where you stand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, Forbes has a domain authority score of 93. The higher the rating, the <em>better<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1757\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/blog3.jpg\" alt=\"Forbes website domain authority \" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you receive a dofollow backlink from an established and trusted website like Forbes, you\u2019ve struck gold. Not only will you receive an influx of high-quality traffic, but Google\u2019s algorithm will also give you a much-needed boost in rankings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while backlink quality matters, backlink quantity is equally essential. Master the art of <strong>consistent link building<\/strong> so you can claim <em>and<\/em> retain your spot on the first SERP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Search Intent<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\u2019s ranking algorithm is whip-smart. It cleverly ranks pages based on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2019\/04\/25\/how-search-intent-can-be-the-foundation-of-a-successful-seo-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\">search intent<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you\u2019re looking to purchase shoes online in Miami, the algorithm will detect that you\u2019re in \u201cbuying mode\u201d right off the bat. Instead of receiving a cluster of different search results that leave you flustered, you\u2019ll view a streamlined set of relevant pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a glimpse:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1758\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/blog4.jpg\" alt=\"shoe store\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice how each page is tailored for web users who are in \u201cbuying mode\u201d and interested in making a transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, if someone was interested in learning how to lace shoes, the algorithm would quickly pick up on that and offer results for web users in \u201clearning mode\u201d:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1759\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Communication.jpg\" alt=\"shoe laces\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Each result includes the phrases \u201chow to,\u201d \u201cways,\u201d or \u201cmethods\u201d to help readers learn, as opposed to buy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the page may include a clever <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescoachescouncil\/2018\/12\/26\/why-your-call-to-action-needs-to-be-clear-and-compelling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\">call-to-action<\/a> toward the end that prompts action. However, that\u2019s not the main concern of the reader, and Google knows that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a marketer, you need to understand this distinction and create content accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing your page for search intent will ultimately help your business become a familiar sight on the first SERP. If you run a local business, you\u2019ll manage to break into the coveted <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/what-is-googles-local-3-pack-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-rank\/\">Google Local 3-Pack<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the most effective <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/the-2020-seo-roadmap-for-small-businesses\/\">local SEO strategies for small businesses<\/a> to help you master the art of creating and optimizing content for local search.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Winning Content That Consistently Stands Out<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1760\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Communication1.jpg\" alt=\"man creating content on his laptop in a professional setting\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, content. We doubt there will ever be a day when content isn\u2019t one of the (if not \u201cthe\u201d) best ways to rank higher on Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we segue into the importance of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/why-content-driven-seo-is-the-ultimate-digital-marketing-strategy-for-2020\/\">producing winning content<\/a><\/strong>, it\u2019s essential to note that search intent closely ties in with this ranking factor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, you\u2019re producing content <em>for<\/em> customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throwing intent out of the mix will leave you with content that fails to achieve its purpose. Instead, keep a laser-sharp focus on what your audience wants and go the extra mile to supply it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We suggest using Google Trends for staying abreast of the latest news updates, events, and happenings that are currently trending. Create content plans around these trends to give your audience exactly what they\u2019re actively searching for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, create personalized pages for different demographics (e.g. age, location, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run a local clothing store in Arizona, it\u2019s very likely that your target audience will run searches similar to \u201ctrendy clothes in Arizona,\u201d \u201csummer outfit trends Arizona,\u201d \u201cstunning outfits for teens Arizona.\u201d Create a customized page for all major subsets of search intent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covering all bases will help your website actively circulate the web and appear in the results for hyper-specific search queries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Expert Keyword Research and Use<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1761\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/fb1.jpg\" alt=\"graphic design illustrating keyword research \" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019re not a seasoned SEO pro and have been casually dabbling in the digital marketing landscape, we\u2019re sure you\u2019re still familiar with the make-it-or-break-it nature of keywords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To cut to the chase, keywords have been long placed on the golden pedestal of SEO\u2014and rightfully so. Expert keyword research can boost content from the 6<sup>th<\/sup> page of SERPs to the first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how should you go about it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend <strong>getting in touch with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/seo-keyword-research\/\">keyword specialists<\/a><\/strong> who have extensive experience in researching relevant keywords for a wide range of industries. They\u2019ll equip you with the top-ranking keywords in your niche so your content stands out instead of simply floating across odd SERPs on the web.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, focus on incorporating the following keywords into your content:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Short-Tail Keywords:<\/strong> Short keywords comprising 2\u20133 words<\/li>\n<li><strong>Long-Tail Keywords:<\/strong> Long and specific keywords comprising over 3 words<\/li>\n<li><strong>Geo-Targeting Keywords:<\/strong> Keywords that target a specific location (e.g. neighborhood, town, city, state, country, etc.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) Keywords:<\/strong> Conceptual terms that are closely related to the main keyword<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Use anchor text for your keywords, wherever possible, to ensure they stand out and prompt action. This is a great way to boost rankings and compel web users to invest in your products\/services, engage with earlier content, or simply stick around longer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporate keyword-rich anchor text within the first 100 words of your content to increase your chances of appearing on the first SERP. Also known as <strong><u>keyword prominence<\/u><\/strong>, this nifty strategy will help your content rank higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, be careful about <strong><u>keyword density<\/u><\/strong> to avoid going overboard and potentially getting penalized by Google. Keyword density is the percentage of keywords used as a factor of the total words appearing on the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you write a 500-word blog and include 5 keywords, your keyword density is 1%. Ideally, we suggest opting for 2\u20134% keyword density to ensure your content appears on SERPs without risking the chance of overwhelming your audience or getting blacklisted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using white hat keyword research and use strategies is a great way to find the perfect balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, pay close attention to <strong><u>keyword proximity<\/u><\/strong>. This factor refers to the distance between each keyword.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say your keyword is \u201cLos Angeles residential doors\u201d and you incorporate it into your content as \u201cLos Angeles doors for all your residential needs.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The search term proximity between \u201cLos Angeles\u201d and \u201cdoors\u201d is excellent since there are no interruptive words in between. However, the search term proximity between \u201cdoors\u201d and \u201cresidential\u201d is three words, which isn\u2019t great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1762\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/fb2.jpg\" alt=\"Rule of Thumb\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Using keywords <em>as they are<\/em> as much as possible will help your website dominate the web!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.
