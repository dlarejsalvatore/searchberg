It is also the part that <u>never ends<\/u> until unless you are ranking #1 for every single keyword you are targeting.This part is tough, but the link building possibilities are also endless which is why Off-page Optimization will be the topic of today\u2019s post as we focus on the art of building links. We highlight some very popular, useful and result-driven link building services that should be a top priority for all businesses seeking to enhance online presence and visibility in 2016 and beyond!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Check out our infographic on the<strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/impact-of-seo-services-on-small-businesses\/\">Impact of SEO Services on Small Businesses<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Content Marketing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>After Panda and Penguin, Content has come under a whole new spotlight. There are rewards for investing in quality and presentation. Writing a lengthy post on a good topic is great. But if that post is not supplemented with proper images, graphics, statistics or any type of relevant visual material, your content will only look like random boring text.<\/p>\n<p>Viewer intent is paramount in content marketing. Figuring out what people are searching for is one thing. Presenting it is another. The first part involves proper research to come up with list of topics that would make great articles pieces or blog posts. The other part is writing them well and that entails asking questions. Should it be an opinion piece or a stat\u2019s based informative piece? Will it include stats or reference to other websites supplementing the point being made in the post?<\/p>\n<p>Having a blog on your website is a huge plus. For some industries, it is actually required in order to portray a professional and strong brand image. Blogs are great way to get your website indexed frequently.

That particular comment from Matt Cutts was more in response to people abusing the guest post strategy by submitting lengthy irrelevant, low quality content on sites that would literally accept any content for a backlink without checking for authenticity, relevancy, and quality.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that authority sites that focus on their respective areas of expertise are enjoying a higher standing in Google. They are top ranked for their brand, their keywords and their traffic is increasing as their readership increases. Take websites like Search Engine Land and Moz for example. They specialize in content specifically written for Search Engine Optimization, PPC, and all matters associated with digital marketing.They are regarded as an <u>authority sites<\/u>. People from all over the world contribute via guest post at these forums every day and the website continues to enjoy high rankings.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line,writing <u>quality guest post<\/u> is still a great link building strategy. It yields a high value link from an authority sites and overtime creates a mental perception of authority, and leadership among the target audience. Businesses should seriously look into exploring this option for their SEO.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Social Media Platforms<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The more reachable you are online, the more rewarding the user experience and thus more traffic, more domain authority and more rankings. There was a time when social media used to be a hip thing to do. Now it is a must-do thing. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google+ are some of the top options to explore. However depending on your industry, there are other platforms where you can capitalize on as well such as Instagram and Pinterest. These are great platforms to sport your merchandise or showcase your services.<\/p>\n<p>And let\u2019s not forget Youtube and Vimeo. People respond to visuals, and videos are a great way to get your message across to your target audience. People would rather watch a one minute video than read through lengthy dull text. And besides, it is a proven fact that short version videos tend to have a bigger, longer lasting impact on viewers than text. Creating videos of your business is an excellent way to build your brand, interact with clients, and get a reliable backlink in the process.<\/p>\n<p>These are some popular link building services that you can surely add to your digital marketing strategy for 2016. The main thing to take from this post is that SEO is still alive and in demand. It has taken more of a content-centric form than ever but there are still many ways to build authority links rather than directly submissions.
