As more people gain easy access to your products and services, your business will expand organically.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, you\u2019ll manage to counteract the damage sustained during the initial months of the lockdown.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you understand the importance of having a solidly engaging, interactive, and user-friendly website, you may be wondering how to go about accomplishing solid digital marketing for your small business&#8217; website.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some best practices for you to follow:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keep your <strong>layout simple<\/strong>. Figure out what the absolute essentials of your website are and draw focus to that. This helps your website have a <em>&#8220;clean&#8221;<\/em> aesthetic that is also functional.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Having a clean and functional approach also helps to reduce your load times and make it easier for users to navigate on multiple devices.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Speaking of multiple devices, make absolutely sure that your website is designed to <strong>work in a mobile and tablet format<\/strong> as well as the traditional desktop format.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Not only does this make life far easier for a customer who wants to check out your site on their phone\/tablet, but it also improves your search rankings.<\/p>\n<p>This is because recently, Google has had a <a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/04\/21\/google-mobilegeddon\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mobilegeddon<\/a> tweak to its search algorithm. Basically, if your website does not have a mobile-friendly interface, Google will punish your website by reducing your rankings.<\/p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t forget mobile device compatibility because it can make or break your site&#8217;s rankings.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Make your site&#8217;s <strong>navigation features easy to follow<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As a business, your goal is to have a customer <em>stay <\/em>on your website.<\/p>\n<p>The way that they stay is by clicking around.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, since you want them to stay on your site for longer periods, you need to <strong>make the navigation easy<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Make use of <strong>highlighted calls to action<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To do this effectively, you need to ask yourself what you want your customer to do when they are on your site. Do you want them to buy products, book a phone call, call your business&#8230;?<\/p>\n<p>Figure out your calls to action and slap them on your site.<\/p>\n<p>Highlight and design them in such a way that the user can&#8217;t miss them without being obnoxiously sales-y. Simple buttons work just fine for this.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to your web pages and outside content, you can also use calls to action <strong>throughout your content<\/strong> when they become relevant.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Lastly, don&#8217;t underestimate the power of <strong>simple, good-looking, <\/strong>and<strong> easy-to-read font<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>2.

However, leaving them unattended could harm your brand in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>As potential customers interact with the negative content, they\u2019re likely to change their minds and look for a competitor who offers similar products\/services. In addition, you run the risk of losing unsatisfied customers by leaving their complaints unattended.<\/p>\n<p>This is where\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/8-reasons-to-protect-your-brands-online-reputation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic\/\">reputation management experts<\/a>\u00a0step in.<\/p>\n<p>They help brands detect and respond to negative feedback in an empathetic, polite, and remedial manner.
