So while you may have created engaging content, forgoing optimization could easily take you back to square one.<\/p>\n<p>The first step to leveraging SEO is prioritizing on-page optimization.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, on-page SEO is the practice of optimizing web content, product\/service pages, and additional pages to earn higher rankings on SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>An added benefit? You\u2019ll manage to attract quality traffic instead of desultory digital window shoppers.<\/p>\n<p>Kick the process off by compiling a list of essential on-page SEO factors you should prioritize.<\/p>\n<p>We suggest focusing on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title tags<\/li>\n<li>Meta descriptions<\/li>\n<li>Header tags<\/li>\n<li>Content headlines (H1 tags, H2 tags)<\/li>\n<li>Alt text and descriptive titles for image optimization<\/li>\n<li>URL optimization<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Optimize each component of your web page by using relevant keywords that not only increase visibility and help you climb SERPs, but also improve click-through rates.<\/p>\n<p>Using the right tags will also lend legitimacy and authority to your content. This will lead to Google perceiving your website as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/8-reasons-to-protect-your-brands-online-reputation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic\/\">reputable source<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The outcome? Improved rankings and greater chances of earning <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/build-high-quality-backlinks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201dnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">high-quality backlinks<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Using relevant and concise title tags and meta descriptions is a great way to boost organic rankings. As visitors are informed about the content enclosed within each web page, they\u2019re more likely to find the information they\u2019re looking for, and are more likely to click-through as a result.<\/p>\n<p>We also suggest writing compelling (and optimized) headlines to entice users to engage with your content. This subtle yet powerful optimization tactic is popularly used to turn an impression into a click.<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescommunicationscouncil\/2018\/08\/08\/dont-get-left-behind-optimize-image-search-ranking-to-increase-organic-traffic\/#18ab0b672b64\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201dnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">image optimization<\/a> is usually overlooked by most small businesses, it\u2019s a powerful weapon in the SEO arsenal. From improving page load times to enhancing user experience, image optimization plays a central role in ensuring your audience sticks around. Use alt text and descriptive titles to boost your website\u2019s SEO ranking, while also making it more accessible to people with special needs.<\/p>\n<p>We also recommend making the most of URL optimization by keeping URL lengths short, using lowercase letters, ensuring readability, and using hyphens instead of underscores. Of course, don\u2019t forget to include relevant keywords.<\/p>\n<p>According to research, short URLs have a <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/search-engine-ranking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201dnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">ranking advantage<\/a> over long URLs.<\/p>\n<p>While these changes may seem overlookable at first glance, they can <em>heavily<\/em> impact the visibility and rankings of your website.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc52790469\"><\/a>2.

Their efficacy has to do with their descriptive nature. While users were previously more interested in running concise queries, there has been a recent shift toward more detailed\u2014albeit precise\u2014queries.<\/p>\n<p>While the length is slightly longer to direct more relevant search results, the searches are still relatively succinct.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, long-tail keywords also help search engines understand the nature of your content better.<\/p>\n<p>We suggest hiring SEO experts to help research and shortlist relevant industry-specific keywords for your content. While there are several free tools available, they lack the comprehensiveness and exactness of cutting-edge paid tools.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, striking the right balance in your keyword strategy will help you gain traction and ensure your content speedily climbs SERPs!<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc52790471\"><\/a>4.
