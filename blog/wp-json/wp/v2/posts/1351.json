Businesses, both small and large, rely on the internet to reach out to a worldwide audience and market their products\/services. In short, digital marketing has become the new norm.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2103\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blog1.jpg\" alt=\"concept illustration of the process of guest blogging for SEO\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Creating online blogs is a marketing technique that is popular among many small and large businesses\u2014and this isn\u2019t surprising. It\u2019s an effective and efficient way to establish yourself as an authority in your industry and draw attention to your offerings. In fact, a survey conducted by HubSpot revealed that blogging is the\u00a0top content marketing priority for 53% of marketers.<\/p>\n<p>But, just like any other type of blog, it can be quite tricky to maintain a small business blog. It takes a lot of effort and a significant amount of research to draw and capture the attention of today\u2019s highly impatient online consumers.<\/p>\n<p>In order to create a successful blog, you need to have a firm understanding of your target audience, develop a robust blogging schedule, create fresh content that interests readers, and design a visually engaging, user-friendly, and interactive website.<\/p>\n<p>The question on many business owner&#8217;s minds is: does Guest Blogging improve or have benefits for SEO?<\/p>\n<p>While building authority by creating and maintaining a blog is all well and good, a small business (or any sized business really) also requires the support of its peers to succeed\u2014and this is where\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/guest-blogging.html\">guest blogging for SEO<\/a><\/u>\u00a0comes in.<\/p>\n<p>You see, it\u2019s not difficult to find websites with big audiences that are willing to help you grow your small business. Collaborating with them by publishing quality guest posts on their platform exposes your businesses to a large audience, and ultimately drives traffic to your website.<\/p>\n<p>Here are five reasons why\u00a0guest blogging is the key that opens the doors to brand development, customer acquisition, and small business growth.<\/p>\n<h2>Expand on Social Media<\/h2>\n<p>You can also grow your brand presence on social media as a result of guest blogging.<\/p>\n<p>This is one of the biggest pros of Guest Blogging for small businesses and bloggers.<\/p>\n<p>Social media shares definitely follow a domino effect once the sharing ball gets rolling on your content.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you are sending your guest post to a website that gets a fair amount of social media shares, it is likely that your post will get a lot of shares as well.<\/p>\n<p>A hack to triple and even quadruple the number of shares you get through social media through a guest post and otherwise is to embed high-value sharable content within your blog.<\/p>\n<p>This can look like a really helpful infographic.<\/p>\n<p>The best kind of infographics are those that break down complex topics and content into easily digestible and understandable graphics or flow charts.<\/p>\n<p>To get you started on your infographic, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2021\/01\/25\/12-effective-ways-to-use-infographics-for-marketing\/?sh=7ee681fb6da1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> is an awesome guide to help you create yours today.<\/p>\n<p>The great thing about guest posts is that your page will be linked back to and tagged.<\/p>\n<p>Guest blogging can, in this way, increase not only the social media shares of your content but also increase your follower count and your lead generating efforts.<\/p>\n<p>By getting your work published on a blog that has authority, you are essentially upping your own authority as well because they are referring you as a credible source to their audience.<\/p>\n<p>When you get to create your contributing profile, in order to maximize click-throughs to your social media, make sure to link to your accounts in your bio section.<\/p>\n<p>This way, specific readers who take the time to check out your author bio will actually be able to connect with you or your business via social media, making your posts a regular part of their newsfeeds.<\/p>\n<p>Since you now have them on your social feeds, you want to remind them why they followed you.<\/p>\n<p>The way you do this is by regularly posting high caliber, helpful content for them to digest. Not only does this engage the followers you garnered from the guest blog you posted, but it also helps your organic reach on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Content truly is king, so don&#8217;t forget to keep providing value to stay at the forefront of your audience&#8217;s minds.<\/p>\n<h2>Create Brand Awareness &amp; Enhance Online Exposure<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most significant benefits of guest blogging for small business owners is increased online exposure and brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>Why do these matter?<\/p>\n<p>Well, nobody will spend money on your business if they don\u2019t know it exists, right?<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, guest blogging gets your name out there and thus benefits your small business&#8217;s SEO.<\/p>\n<p>Considering how intensely competitive the digital marketing environment is today, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s ideal to\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/10-advanced-link-building-tips-and-tricks-to-boost-your-seo\/\">earn quality backlinks<\/a><\/u>\u00a0and\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/what-is-googles-local-3-pack-and-how-can-you-use-it-to-rank\/\">climb SERPs<\/a><\/u>?<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, notable online marketing experts believe that it takes around\u00a05 to 7 impressions\u00a0before a consumer is able to remember your brand, which means that in order to make the greatest impact, it\u2019s essential to write relevant guest blogs as frequently as possible.<\/p>\n<p>But how exactly does guest blogging\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescoachescouncil\/2019\/10\/02\/13-budget-friendly-methods-for-increasing-brand-awareness\/#6ec8d620320d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">create brand awareness<\/a><\/u>\u00a0and increase exposure for your business? Well, let us explain through an example. Let\u2019s assume that you have the opportunity to publish a guest blog on a site that has 100,000 followers, and 10,000 of them end up reading your blog. Even if the likelihood of getting redirected traffic from this post to your site is low, you still get the chance to introduce your businesses to thousands of potential consumers.<\/p>\n<p>But how do you increase the chances of acquiring redirected traffic? Well, here\u2019s what you need:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1358\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Targeted-Audience-and-Targeted-Keyword.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"250\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Improve your niche-wide authority<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a formula for transforming your guest content efforts into leads for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Good, helpful content + high authority site within your niche = greater authority within your niche = greater trust among potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>This greater trust comforts the followers of your work to convert from prospects to paying customers\/clients.<\/p>\n<p>Guest blogging in this way helps your target audience see you as a credible, reliable source of information to help them solve their pain-points.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, because of this initial trust, they are more open to the value propositions that you present to them.<\/p>\n<p>A hot lead that trusts your authority will always convert faster than a cold one.<\/p>\n<h2>Increase your qualified leads<\/h2>\n<p>A qualified lead is essentially a lead that is further down the sales process.<\/p>\n<p>They have already expressed interest in your value proposition and therefore need less convincing to convert as opposed to someone who is simply browsing.<\/p>\n<p>To get these qualified leads, the key is to find websites to guest post on that already have a regular and reliable flow of traffic as well as relevancy in your niche.<\/p>\n<p>It is unlikely that you will be able to guest post with a direct competitor but try to find a high authority, a well-respected site within your niche as a whole to post on.<\/p>\n<p>When you post your links within your blog, there is a certain art and finesse to making sure people want to click that big call-to-action button, which leads to your website.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, it can very well be perceived as a useless waste of space that took up the reader&#8217;s time without a pay-off rather than the highly converting benefit of Guest Blogging that it can be.<\/p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this approach (or lack thereof) can result in very few click-throughs and leads from the guest post.<\/p>\n<p>The key is to create unity between the CTA you post and the actual page that it leads to.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure both of these are related to the overall content of the guest post you are writing.<\/p>\n<p>This <strong>actionable step<\/strong> should read in the prospect&#8217;s mind as a <strong>reasonable next step from the guest blog<\/strong> they just read in order to solve their pain-point.<\/p>\n<p>Use This Content Marketing Opportunity to Shorten Your Sales Cycle<\/p>\n<p>The key here is that rather than waiting for potential customers to show up on your website, you get to help them discover your unique value proposition on a trusted third-party website.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, you get to shorten your sales process for your services and products.<\/p>\n<p>To capitalize on the match between your value proposition and the topic you write about, you need to be very strategic about what you blog about.<\/p>\n<p>Think of yourself as a guest blogging ninja who is there to strike specific key pain-points that are relevant to the solutions you provide (i.e., your services and products).<\/p>\n<h2>Educational Content<\/h2>\n<p>Ensure that the content of your guest blog is\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2019\/08\/23\/how-educational-content-can-lead-to-more-business\/#1db341d92617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">engaging and educational<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>Discuss trends and insights to become an authoritative voice in the industry and increase your chances of persuading readers to visit your website.<\/p>\n<p>The reason that educational content performs so well is that bridging people&#8217;s gaps in their knowledge helps them to solve problems and understand their pain-points better so that they can tackle them more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Good educational content provides value.<\/p>\n<p>Engaging and good educational content provides value and builds engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Try to be the professor that enthralls and inspires his or her class to change the way that they think to solve their problems.<\/p>\n<p>The root of most problems is, after all, a mindset difference.<\/p>\n<p>This is a key advantage of Guest Blogging for startups who are still building their name and can exponentially speed up the process.<\/p>\n<p>Empowered with the right knowledge presented to them in the right way, people act differently, and for that mindset shift, a prospect will be grateful.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc51075634\"><\/a>Call to Action<\/h2>\n<p>What\u2019s the point of investing your precious time and resources to create quality content and not get even a single email in return?

Utilize email marketing in an efficient manner and watch how fast your small business grows.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest key to building your email list, which you can even discuss and link in your guest post, is to create an &#8220;opt-in incentive.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is some document, video, training, etc., that provides value to your prospective customer.<\/p>\n<p>Some examples of this are a checklist, an ebook, an exclusive video or video series, etc. Whatever format you choose, the incentive you provide needs to be electrifying and value-adding enough that your prospect will want it to help them solve their problem.<\/p>\n<p>In exchange for this amazing, value-adding piece of content you provide them with, your opt-in form will ask for their email address.<\/p>\n<p>Once they&#8217;ve opted in, and your email marketing software has sent them their opt-in incentive, boom &#8211; you&#8217;ve got a new email subscriber, and your list is primed to grow in this way.<\/p>\n<p>However, there\u2019s one mistake that you should avoid at all costs:\u00a0<em>spamming.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Developing an email list can be quite a tricky undertaking, especially if you\u2019re new on the block.
