Whether you want to promote your YouTube channel for free\u00a0or go all in and benefit from a full suite of SEO services, there\u2019s something here for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>SEO is one of those things everyone knows a little about. Most people know that it involves:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>keywords<\/li>\n<li>optimization<\/li>\n<li>alt text,<\/li>\n<li>and more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But even as these words are tossed around by people around you, very few people can claim expertise in it. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/youtube-seo-smart-digital-marketing-in-2019-to-expand-your-audience-promote-your-business-and-strengthen-your-brand\/\"><u>We\u2019ve written about this previously<\/u><\/a>, so take a look if you\u2019re interested.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s get specific; here are some steps you can take to ensure that the YouTube algorithm laps up your content:<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc69150610\"><\/a>a)\u00a0<a name=\"_Toc68802093\"><\/a>Come Up With a Killer Title<\/h3>\n<p>The thumbnail (more on this later) and title are your first points of contact with potential subscribers; so, you need to invest a lot of time into getting them right.<\/p>\n<p>Your titles need to strike the right balance between compelling and informative (and they can never be spammy). You also need to keep them short; 60 characters is the sweet spot.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a description that\u2019s toeing the line:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3128\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sample-title-youtube.jpg\" alt=\"Example of how to use titles to promote a YouTube video to get more views.\" width=\"366\" height=\"76\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The views speak for themselves, but what is it about the title that gets so many views? Well, it\u2019s got volume for one\u201415 hacks mean a meaty video, and people love bang for their YouTube buck (read: time). On top of that, the word hacks, coupled with genius, elevates the video above others; say, for example, one that said \u201c4 Plumbing Hacks You Need to Know.\u201d Generating excitement is super important in titles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip: Try to get all your essential keywords in the beginning of the title; doing so really does maximize views\u2014people on YouTube are usually looking for solutions, so don\u2019t waste their time. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As for the compelling bit, let\u2019s look at an example. Say you\u2019re running a diet and lifestyle channel, and are making an explainer video about the differences between the Keto Diet and the Atkins diet. Let\u2019s take a look at two title options:<\/p>\n<p><strong><b>Our Take on the Timeless Atkins vs. Keto Debate<\/b><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Vs.<\/p>\n<p><strong><b>Comparison of Atkins and Keto<\/b><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most of us would click on the first one over the second\u2014at least we hope so. It puts your personality front and center (our take), and has both the essential keywords in about 50 characters or so. That\u2019s a win!<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s a winning formula for keywords? Here\u2019s a breakdown:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the YouTube autocomplete suggestions to find keywords that your audience is actually using.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid stuffing keywords into the title\u2014use as many as you can without stylistic compromises.<\/li>\n<li>Pair keywords with titles that spark curiosity.<\/li>\n<li>Modify keywords as needed to\u2014YouTube, like Google, can make out semantic differences.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc69150611\"><\/a>b)\u00a0<a name=\"_Toc68802094\"><\/a>Make Full Use of Video Descriptions<\/h3>\n<p>Good descriptions follow many of the same rules that good titles do; it\u2019s just a difference of volume\u20145,000 as opposed to 60 characters.<\/p>\n<p>Like the titles, keywords should be front and center; but there\u2019s more! You can use descriptions to send view counts soaring across your channel. Do this by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linking to existing videos that didn\u2019t get the success they deserve, or<\/li>\n<li>by directing views to an entire playlist of similar content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk examples now:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3129\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/sample-youtube-description.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of video marketing strategy on YouTube by using descriptions to their full potential.\" width=\"500\" height=\"354\" \/><\/p>\n<p>MKBHD isn\u2019t the biggest tech YouTuber out there for nothing\u2014notice how he plugs in his merch page, his Amazon affiliate link, <em><i>and<\/i><\/em>\u00a0a playlist of other videos in one description, while also having all his socials there too.<\/p>\n<p>So, the takeaway is: give the people what they want, and watch the views roll in.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68784573\"><\/a>c)\u00a0<a name=\"_Toc68802095\"><\/a><a name=\"_Toc69150612\"><\/a>#Hashtags\u00a0For the Win<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3130\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/youtube-hashtags.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of YouTube hashtags\" width=\"488\" height=\"55\" \/><\/p>\n<p>YouTube recently introduced hashtags, and they took the platform by storm not soon after. Much like Twitter, use them to send people down a discoverability rabbit hole. Just make sure you\u2019re using the right ones (tools like Google\u2019s Keyword Planner are your best bet here)<\/p>\n<p>Viewers who click on them and find similar content are much more likely to binge watch it. We like to call it the hashtag hook, line, and sinker.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc69150613\"><\/a>d)\u00a0Tap Into Tags For Even More Discoverability<\/h3>\n<p>YouTube\u2019s Creator Studio allows you to embed tags\u2014essentially keywords that you want to rank for\u2014in your videos. They\u2019re the least important piece of the YouTube metadata puzzle, but they can get you over the edge when it comes to discovery.<\/p>\n<p>We always suggest adding them because in your quest toward eventual bigtime YouTube fame, you can\u2019t leave any stone unturned.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68784575\"><\/a><a name=\"_Toc68802097\"><\/a><a name=\"_Toc69150614\"><\/a>Some Takeaways<\/h3>\n<p>Remember, Google owns YouTube, and it\u2019ll always be a search company first. And search and SEO go hand in hand. This means you need to know the algorithm really well\u2014how it works, what kind of content it prefers, and what it doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>For example, YouTube transcribes your entire video every time you upload, so even your videos aren\u2019t exempt from keyword optimization!<\/p>\n<p>If this sounds overwhelming, we have some good news: the map to success is already in front of you; all you need to do is see how others are optimizing their videos (especially the most successful creators) and follow suit.<\/p>\n<p>YouTube SEO is involved, we\u2019re not going to lie; if the time investment is too much for you because of the millions of other responsibilities you have, you could always <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/seo-services\/\"><u>hire us to do it for you<\/u><\/a>\u2014we\u2019d be glad to help.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc69150615\"><\/a>2.\u00a0Big Collaborations for Big Success<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3131\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/beauty-youtubers-collab.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of a video of beauty influencers all collaborating, which collectively promotes\u00a0all their YouTube channels\" width=\"602\" height=\"119\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The first question that popped up in your head after reading this was probably: \u201c<em><i>But who would want to collaborate with me when I have no views or subscribers?<\/i><\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The answer, surprisingly, is that a lot of bigger creators would. The key is to perfect the two Ps: the pitch and persistence.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of bigger creators are looking for an opportunity to shine a spotlight on up-and-coming talent\u2014and if you\u2019ve been a long-time subscriber, they\u2019re even more likely to take you up on the offer, especially if you\u2019re in the same niche.<\/p>\n<p>Make it beneficial for them\u2014content ideas like fan Q&amp;As are surefire hits; it\u2019s an offer that\u2019s hard to say no to.<\/p>\n<p>But what, why do you want to do this, again? Here are some obvious benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The scale of their much bigger platform.<\/li>\n<li>The collab will send viewers torpedoing toward your channel, while also giving you a ton of credibility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Everyone respects clout; so standing in the shadow of a YouTube giant won\u2019t dim your light; it\u2019ll help you shine brighter than ever. In the business, we call it building industry authority.<\/p>\n<p>Not to mention that bigger creators have really diverse audiences; this can open you up to so many new content possibilities as your subscribers diversify.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, YouTube is a personality-first platform; as long as you have an electric personality and are good at what you do, other creators will be on board.<\/p>\n<p>The best part is that there are no consequences with reaching out\u2014it\u2019s free, and the worst you can expect to hear is radio silence.<\/p>\n<p>Another option is to partner with other influencers or even endorse a business\u2019s product; a lot of businesses will pay to promote your content if their product is in it\u2014it\u2019s a you scratch my back world out there\u2014which can be a great equalizer if you don\u2019t have a PPC budget to speak of.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc69150616\"><\/a>3.\u00a0Don\u2019t Forget to Engage With Your Audience<\/h2>\n<p>Just like Kendrick Lamar, it\u2019s important to stay humble and remember who got you the success you have today. In this case, it\u2019s your existing audience!<\/p>\n<p>As it turns out, the biggest advantage you have is how small your YouTube presence is. Lost us? Let us explain: People love content creators who exude charm and have an electric personality\u2014the problem is one of discoverability, not talent.<\/p>\n<p>So, when you do start attracting a (small) audience, it\u2019s very likely that they\u2019ll start feeling a sense of belonging with you due to the intimate, small nature of your account.<\/p>\n<p>A small audience of, say, 500 people allows you to engage with every single comment. It allows you to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send push notifications that are customized.<\/li>\n<li>Highlight some subscribers in every video (who doesn\u2019t love a shoutout!).<\/li>\n<li>Have a back-and-forth conversation with them where you address them by name.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All of these are super underrated promotional techniques that go a long way.<\/p>\n<p>Your subscribers are very likely to rave about you in their inner circles, which will have a trickle-down effect on your follower count.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, the more success you get the less intimate the channel will be, but it\u2019s important to double down on this while you\u2019re a small creator.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, all this requires is you putting yourself out there and being true to yourself; try not to perform or put on a persona (unless that\u2019s what your account is about) and have honest conversations with your audience. Nothing works better on YouTube than a bit of vulnerability.<\/p>\n<p>Even large channels take out the time to do this:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3132\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/viewer-engagement-youtube.jpg\" alt=\"Comment replies and engagement, and example of a solid YouTube marketing strategy.\" width=\"602\" height=\"336\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice how the guys over at Hardware Unboxed have liked the first comment, and have also left one of their trademark Aussie witticisms under another; viewers love being made to feel special\u2014it can set you up for a lifetime of loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>You also want to know them like you know the back of your hand; remember, YouTube doesn\u2019t give you tons of analytics data for kicks\u2014tap into their demographics, locations, preferences, etc. to make content accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>You also want to rely on your subscribers to double down on your success\u2014is someone subscribed but hasn\u2019t clicked the vaunted bell icon? Ask them to in a video!<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc68784578\"><\/a>4.\u00a0<a name=\"_Toc68802100\"><\/a><a name=\"_Toc69150617\"><\/a>Call(s) to Action<\/h2>\n<p>YouTube is probably the only platform where you can get away with adding all kinds of calls to action to your content.<\/p>\n<p>We already hinted as much with the title and the thumbnail, but you can double down with multiple CTAs in your video.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve probably seen hundreds of YouTube videos that ask you to \u201cclick on the bell icon to get my videos the moment I post them.\u201d Yep, that\u2019s a CTA.<\/p>\n<p>How about this one: \u201cRemember to like and subscribe to my channel if you enjoyed my video.\u201d Also a CTA.<\/p>\n<p>And the thing is, it works; videos with multiple compelling CTAs get viewers to take a desired action. Why? Because YouTube is, you guessed it, a personality-first platform, if people like you enough, they won\u2019t find this spammy.<\/p>\n<p>It <em><i>can <\/i><\/em>get spammy if done too much, so try to figure out where the line is, and never cross it. This is the most important thing you need to figure out when trying to promote your YouTube videos.<\/p>\n<p><strong><b>Here\u2019s a small scenario to demonstrate<\/b><\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>A long-time subscriber to your household hacks channel hasn\u2019t been getting your videos in their feed for some reason (it happens a lot!). But then they navigate over to your channel to see what you\u2019ve been up to.<\/p>\n<p>When they do, the first thing they hear in your latest video is that a lot of people haven\u2019t been seeing your videos, and to click on the bell icon to get push notifications. If the person loves your content and persona, it\u2019s more than likely that they\u2019ll follow through.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, YouTube then gets a signal that people want more of your content, and the algorithm will play ball accordingly.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc69150618\"><\/a>5.\u00a0Choose the Right Length For Your Videos<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3133\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/nyan-cat.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of a long nyan cat video used as an example of how not to promote YouTube videos\" width=\"602\" height=\"373\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><b>Don\u2019t follow in the footsteps of this <\/b><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SkgTxQm9DWM\"><strong><u><b>10-hour Nyan Cat video<\/b><\/u><\/strong><\/a><strong><b>!<\/b><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Depending on what kind of content you make, the length of your videos really does determine whether viewers stick around till the end.

And you don\u2019t want to be done before they are!<\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re running a channel that gives people tips and life hacks that help them fix things around the home space, viewers will really appreciate shorter videos because all they want is that broken pipe to stop leaking.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that YouTube gives all kinds of metrics; so, all you need to do is track when people stop watching, how engaged people are in different sections of the video, and what video lengths on your channel are most popular.

Just remember, when jumping on a bandwagon, paint it in your own colors.<\/p>\n<p>What we mean to say is, you can\u2019t just do what everyone else is doing\u2014think of how you can put a personal spin on these trends because that\u2019s what brought your followers to you in the first place.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc68784582\"><\/a>8.\u00a0<a name=\"_Toc68802104\"><\/a><a name=\"_Toc69150621\"><\/a>Doubling Down on Successful Content Strategies<\/h2>\n<p>If you have a video that made a wave in the YouTube space, but the rest of your videos fell flat, it\u2019s probably a safe bet to make a second part to that video.<\/p>\n<p>YouTube is a limited risk game; you take gambit after gambit until you find a strategy that works for you\u2014and then you should stick to it.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re not saying you shouldn\u2019t make any big content bets anymore, just that you need to have a stable of ol\u2019 reliable content that you can always bank on during a dry spell.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a few ideas to ensure great viewership numbers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put the series of videos you make into playlists.<\/li>\n<li>At the end of every video, remind your viewers to check out all the other videos in the playlist.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Also remember that YouTube gives you a lot of tools\u2014use them! From the channel introduction video to featured videos, and recently, YouTube Shorts and Stories (the last two particularly are known for bringing in a swarm of new viewers), if you tap into YouTube\u2019s full potential, you\u2019re looking at a future success story.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc68784583\"><\/a>9.\u00a0<a name=\"_Toc68802105\"><\/a><a name=\"_Toc69150622\"><\/a>To Facebook and Beyond<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3136\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/other-social-media-platforms.jpg\" alt=\"An image of social media platforms Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t just stay on a YouTube shaped island if you\u2019re going to make it big on the platform. You need to venture out and sail to other social media shores.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, for example, has hundreds of groups for all kinds of industry niches. These groups are rife with conversion potential, because you already know that the people on them are deeply invested in the type of content you produce. If you want to promote your YouTube videos on Facebook, this is the holy grail.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t just post links to your videos ad nauseam; it\u2019ll be considered spam and might even get you booted! Instead, build relationships on these groups, help people out, and establish trust. Alongside, use your Facebook profile as a landing page of sorts\u2014the people you help will click on your profile, and when they do, they\u2019ll see that you\u2019re also a content creator.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, because of the work you\u2019ve put in, they\u2019re <em><i>very <\/i><\/em>likely to click through and subscribe. The spillover effect is that YouTube will get a ton of search signals from this, indicating that your channel is one they want to promote and put forward in recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>For Instagram, don\u2019t make the mistake of using it as a promotional page; no one wants to see a whole feed of \u201cnew video up, link in the bio!\u201d It\u2019s repetitive, and just a bad strategy overall. Instead, use your Insta feed like a lifestyle page; it\u2019s an added flair that\u2019ll flesh out your online presence.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t cage yourself in by only looking for keywords that rank in YouTube search. Videos are taking Google SERPs by storm, so you really want to be making content that can rank on the first page of Google for a given keyword.<\/p>\n<p>Ask bloggers and other platform holders\u2014nicely\u2014to embed your content; if you see a blog that\u2019s lacking a video element, for example, and yours fits in like the last piece of the puzzle, drop the platform a pitch.<\/p>\n<p>The last bit, ask yourself; no, this isn\u2019t a spirituality thing; we mean to say that if you already have a website with pages that rake in traffic, embed your videos on those pages to take your success into your own hands!<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc68784584\"><\/a>10.\u00a0<a name=\"_Toc68802106\"><\/a><a name=\"_Toc69150623\"><\/a>Comment \u00c7a Va?

And it\u2019s pretty much a given!<\/p>\n<p>But wait, what do closed captions have to do with viewer counts? Remember that little thing called the YouTube algorithm? Well, as it turns out, it wants what\u2019s best for viewers.
