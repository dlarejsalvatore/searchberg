When a majority of your customers are coming through the search engine route, it\u2019s important to pay attention to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/website-seo.html\">website SEO<\/a> strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Especially Google; the search engine <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netmarketshare.com\/search-engine-market-share.aspx?qprid=4&amp;qpcustomd=0\">captures 79 percent<\/a> of all search queries performed on desktop.<\/p>\n<h2>Understanding How Searches Work<\/h2>\n<p>Suppose you enter a keyword onto your Google search bar. Of all the results, the top search result has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginepeople.com\/blog\/page-one-whats-google-rank-worth.html\">33 percent<\/a> likelihood of being clicked. This means that if you\u2019re not the first search result out there, then you\u2019re losing about one-third of your customer traffic to other competitors who hold a higher SEO rank than your business.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps what\u2019s even more mind boggling is that if you\u2019re not listed on the first page, there\u2019s a 75 percent chance you\u2019re not going to get the light of day. That means your goal should be to show up as the first search result on the very first page.<\/p>\n<p>How do you do that?<\/p>\n<p>Having your business rank higher on Google involves serious commitment to improving your SEO strategies. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know anything about that. We\u2019re here to guide you through it all! As the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/\">leading SEO services agency<\/a> in the United States, Search Berg has helped hundreds of clients move up to the top spots of Google search results!<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s blog we\u2019ll be discussing how new businesses can improve their online presence, climb up the SEO rankings and generate more leads and traffic to their website. After all, it is new online businesses that need help with SEO the most. So without further ado, let\u2019s get started!<\/p>\n<h2>1. Improve the loading speed of your page<\/h2>\n<p>Ever been frustrated with a slow buffering speed for a movie or TV show you\u2019re streaming online? In the world of SEO, page loading speeds matter for a handful of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, Google can tell if your page loading speed is slow and will place you lower on the rankings if such is the case. This means there\u2019s a lesser chance for customers to find you. Secondly, slow loading also affects your engagement patterns with your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Research shows that nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingdive.com\/news\/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load\/426070\/\">53 percent of mobile users<\/a> will abandon a website if it doesn\u2019t load in 3 seconds. So you\u2019re losing out on valuable prospective clients with a slow page.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, you\u2019re just going to see negative reviews of your website peppered across search results. Negative reviews and comments can seriously hurt your Google search rankings.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1326\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/b1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"156\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>2. Put up top quality content on your website<\/h2>\n<p>Do you update your website regularly? When it comes to drawing leads and traffic, it helps to post on your website routinely. You need to give your customers a reason to visit your website and that\u2019s why whatever content you post should be recent, relevant and of good quality.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another thing you should keep in mind in terms of your SEO rank: visitor dwell time. This is the amount of time a visitor spends on your website in a single visit. If you\u2019ve got lots of new, exciting content on your page, visitors would likely spend more time on your website.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Optimize images on your website<\/h2>\n<p>Pictures are great additions to websites and are highly encouraged. However, what\u2019s really going to get that rank going is the optimization of your images. This means the size and file format needs to be consistent. Large size pictures that are greater than 5 MB take longer to load and as we\u2019ve discussed, slow pages can push down your Google rank.<\/p>\n<p>Always compress or resize your pictures before uploading them. Also, when you\u2019re naming your pictures, try to mention some keywords in the caption, URL or description. Keywords are super important for your SEO rank and make you highly visible to your potential customers. Read up on point 4 for more details on keywords.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1324\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Optimize images on your website\" width=\"750\" height=\"483\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>4. Use keywords<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/8-major-google-algorithm-updates-explained-282627\">Google\u2019s ranking algorithm<\/a> counts keywords as a major component of the formula. Think about the terms your clients will be searching for when they\u2019re looking for you. Try to sprinkle keywords across all content in a natural way.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, search engines are a lot smarter than we give them credit for. Google can tell when you\u2019ve stuffed keywords just for the sake of building your rank.<\/p>\n<p>Try to include keywords in headers, titles and picture captions so they don\u2019t look odd. Also, make it a point to use long tailed keywords too! These are a combination of 3 or 4 words that act as a searchable phrase. For example if a customer is looking for sports shoes they might just type something like \u201c<em>best shoes for running<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, keep the search entry possibilities in mind when you decide on the keywords you want to be ranked for.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Blog your heart out<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to making choices that are best for business, blogging takes the cake. Blogging can generate leads like no other SEO strategy. It\u2019s also a great way to engage with your visitors and build and organic relationship with them.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the charm behind SEO blogging:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fresh, relevant and newsworthy content will attract people to visit your website and that too for longer dwell-times.<\/li>\n<li>A loyal customer base can keep your rankings high as your generate consistently strong traffic every day.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s easier to include keywords in blog content than into headers and image captions.<\/li>\n<li>Blogs enable solid link building. You can draw connections with local industry businesses and have them link back to you, thereby improving your local SEO ranking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>6. Use external links<\/h2>\n<p>While you blog, remember that citations will be necessary to build up your argument and enhance your website\u2019s credibility. Even if you\u2019re giving out simple tips on how to pack your luggage for a two-hour trip, you need to link to other websites or e-papers so everything looks legit.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure all claims that you\u2019re making are backed by authenticate sources and are recently published. Old content won\u2019t hold much weight in terms of generating leads or SEO ranking. Insert both inbound and outbound links in your content.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Add some color to your website<\/h2>\n<p>Text and hyperlinked text all across the homepage looks too drab to read and is a surefire way to chase away any potential customers. Pictures are important for the mix but you\u2019ve got to try and make your page as interactive as possible. We live in the era of social media, we get bored easily. Give us videos, GIFs, audio recordings and slideshows!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forrester.com\/report\/As+Seen+In+The+Inbox\/-\/E-RES54235\">According to a report by Forrester<\/a>, customers love video marketing over traditional text based marketing. Simply adding a few videos across your website can boost your click-through rates by 300 percent!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1327\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/b2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"156\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>8. Improve site readability<\/h2>\n<p>This is a crucial tip for those website owners who work in a technical field like medicine or software development. When you\u2019re put up content on your page, it\u2019s easy to get carried away with jargon laden language but you have to be considerate about your customer base. You can\u2019t expect every visitor to know exactly what an <a href=\"https:\/\/uhs.berkeley.edu\/facstaff\/ergonomics\/laboratory\/pipettes\">ergonomic pipette<\/a> means.<\/p>\n<p>Also, try to break down all your content into smaller chunks. Use fonts and colors that are easy on the eyes. If you want customers to stay on your site for longer and keep coming back, you\u2019re going to have to think about the user interface.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Don\u2019t forget your mobile device using customers<\/h2>\n<p>Nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/hitwise.connexity.com\/070116_MobileSearchReport_CD_US.html\">60 percent<\/a> of all search engine activity comes from mobile phones. Desktop and laptop users aren\u2019t generating as much traffic to your website as mobile device users are! Google knows this and will rank mobile-friendly websites higher than non-mobile friendly websites.<\/p>\n<p>Long story short, you need to have a responsive website design that is optimized for mobile device use. If you refuse to accommodate for this giant client base, you\u2019re going to miss out on website traffic, leads and ultimately your Google SEO rank.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1325\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/3-2.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t forget your mobile device using customers\" width=\"750\" height=\"483\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>10. Fix broken links and pages<\/h2>\n<p>One of the reasons why we stress on using authentic and reliable sources for linking on your page is because such sources often don\u2019t have broken links.<\/p>\n<p>When you put up a broken link on your page, your SEO ranking immediately takes a nose dive.<\/p>\n<h2>11. Stay active on social media<\/h2>\n<p>Having a stellar website won\u2019t be enough to stay ahead of your competitors. Social media activity plays a huge role in generating traffic to your website.<\/p>\n<p>Link building is a highly effective way to improve your SEO rank and what better place to share your links for mass access than your own social media accounts?<\/p>\n<p>Let your creativity flow and share more than just blog links on your pages. Give quirky infographics a try! It just takes a click for people to share a file and once you\u2019re out on people\u2019s timelines, there\u2019s a high chance you\u2019re going to keep the traffic going for a long time.<\/p>\n<h2>Think you need professional help?<\/h2>\n<p>If social media isn\u2019t your thing or you feel lost on what to post, just give us a call at 855-444-4777!
