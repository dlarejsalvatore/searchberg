They seemingly check off all the boxes by writing engaging, insightful, and industry-specific content.<\/p>\n<p>So, what\u2019s missing? The answer may be right under your nose: <em><u>keywords<\/u><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This phrase is obnoxiously overused in the world of content, but rightfully so. Keywords are the foundation of high-quality content that drives massive sales.<\/p>\n<p>Using a mix of the right exact match, phrase match, broad match, broad match modifier, and negative match keywords, you can turn <u>web browsers into leads<\/u>\u00a0and <u>leads into returning customers<\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, make sure <strong>60% of the keywords you select<\/strong>\u00a0are equipped to drive high conversion rates.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, they should compel your audience to a) take positive action on your site, b) further explore your site, c) return for a purchase at least 1\u20132 times, and d) continue to return for purchases, subscriptions, etc. in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>Your audience shouldn\u2019t simply buy a product\/service and \u201cbounce\u201d; they should feel interested and engaged enough to <em><u>want to stick around<\/u><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Start by selecting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/conversion-rate-optimization\/\"><u>high-CTR (click-through rate) keywords<\/u><\/a>\u00a0that are your top performers. More often than not, these keywords include verbs that prompt action.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s consider an example for more clarity.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you provide ecommerce support to startups and up-and-coming businesses. Instead of solely using keywords like \u201cecommerce services\u201d or \u201ccheap ecommerce solutions,\u201d introduce an actionable verb to the mix.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, keywords like \u201ccreate an ecommerce strategy\u201d and \u201cconsult ecommerce professionals\u201d include verbs (\u201ccreate\u201d and \u201cconsult\u201d) that prompt action.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, they\u2019re <em><u>excellent converters<\/u><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>As web users land on your site and come across more high-converting keywords, they\u2019ll take consistent actions on your site.<\/p>\n<p>This is a great way to keep your target audience on your site for longer, which, in turn, will convert them into long-term customers.<\/p>\n<p>Here are more examples of high-converting keywords to further elucidate this strategy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For attorneys: \u201c<strong><u>Build<\/u><\/strong>a strong case\u201d<\/li>\n<li>For web developers: \u201c<strong><u>Create<\/u><\/strong>an interactive website\u201d<\/li>\n<li>For realtors: \u201c<strong><u>Buy<\/u><\/strong>your dream home\u201d<\/li>\n<li>For door manufacturers: \u201c<strong><u>Replace<\/u><\/strong>your front doors\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See what we mean?

This is why nipping inconsistency and redundancy in the bud is so important.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re short on ideas, turn to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/imghp?hl=EN\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>Google Images<\/u><\/a>\u00a0for help!<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you offer massage therapy services in Atlanta, Georgia.
