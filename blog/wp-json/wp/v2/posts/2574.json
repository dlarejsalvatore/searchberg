The higher your website\u2019s domain authority, the more easily it can rank for your target keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Moz states that a website\u2019s DA is calculated by assessing aspects like linking root domains and the number of total links into a DA score.<\/p>\n<p>DA is scored on a scale of 1\u2013100, with 1 being the lowest performing and 100 being the highest. New websites that have very little to no authority typically start out with a DA of 1. The top websites on the internet, including <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Apple<\/a><\/u>, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">YouTube<\/a><\/u>, and <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google<\/a>,<\/u> have DAs of 100.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc65680081\"><\/a>So, What Is A Good Domain Authority?<\/h3>\n<p>DA below 40 is considered poor; 40\u201350 is considered average; 51\u201360 is good; anything above 60 is excellent.<\/p>\n<p>So clearly, scoring high when it comes to Domain Authority should definitely be on your business\u2019s bucket list. But instead of focusing on getting the highest possible DA and competing with giants like Apple and Google, look at your competitors. Your goal should be to develop a higher domain authority than them.<\/p>\n<p>Small businesses, for example, have a relatively lower DA overall, making it easier for competitors to scope out the landscape and improve their authority.<\/p>\n<p>The next logical question is, how <em>do<\/em> you get high domain authority relative to your competitors?<\/p>\n<p>There are many factors, and in this comprehensive blog, we\u2019ll cover them all in depth.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc65680082\"><\/a>How is Domain Authority Calculated?<\/h3>\n<p>Domain Authority is calculated using the total number of backlinks you receive, including root domains (among a host of other metrics). It defines the ranking capabilities of an entire website for any page it creates, including but not limited to blog posts.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that <strong>Domain Authority<\/strong> is different from <strong>Page Authority (PA)<\/strong>. So what is Page Authority? While PA measures the ranking strength and capabilities of a single web page on a website, DA showcases the strength of the <em>entire website<\/em>, indicating the likelihood of a web page ranking when you create one. While different, PA largely depends on Domain Authority because they ultimately rely on the same factors.<\/p>\n<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s get to our comprehensive ways to increase your site&#8217;s Domain Authority.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc65680083\"><\/a>How to Increase Domain Authority of Your Website?<\/h2>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc65680084\"><\/a>1. Accept Only High-Quality, Relevant Backlinks<\/h3>\n<p>Your backlinks are arguably the most important factor in improving your Domain Authority score.<\/p>\n<p>Backlinks are created when other websites hyperlink to your website.

The industry-standard rule is that do-follow links are better than no-follow links. This is because do-follow links transfer greater &#8220;SEO juice&#8221; from the linking site to yours compared to no-follow links.<\/p>\n<p>No follow links aren&#8217;t bad to have by any means\u2014you just want to try to target more do-follow links because they\u2019ll give you more SEO bang for your buck.

Create a Link Building Strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you know you want to maintain only high quality, high authority links and are well aware of how to disavow unwanted links, you need a strategy to build wanted links.<\/p>\n<p>The first most important building block to any great promotion strategy is having something of note or value to say in your industry. The second is to promote this content using every marketing channel at your disposal.<\/p>\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve created in-depth blogs (we will get into details about <strong><em>how <\/em><\/strong>to create linkable content in a future point), send it to your email list and promote it on your social media channels. Don&#8217;t underestimate organic reach even if you don&#8217;t have a sizable following yet. Use hashtags that are relevant to your industry and content to get more eyeballs on your content.<\/p>\n<p>The next step once you&#8217;ve squared away what you can do on your own is to reach out to the big boys. Or, at least, the <em>bigger <\/em>boys in your industry. As long as their website has a similar or greater authority as yours, you should contact them for a backlink. You want to be subtle as opposed to making demands when you contact them. Make sure you do your research regarding their brand beforehand. If the person&#8217;s audience isn&#8217;t relevant to yours, then there&#8217;s no point reaching out.<\/p>\n<p>Express gratitude for the content they publish. Here, it can help to link to a specific blog that resonated with you, one that is similar in topic to the content you are seeking to build a link with. You can then say in your email or message that you also wrote a new blog about *insert similar topic interest* and that you thought they might enjoy it as someone who writes about said topic\/s.<\/p>\n<p>You can end your email or message by saying that your blog\/guide\/article\/etc. might make a helpful addition to their page. End the message on a positive note and send it off. If they like your content and think it would help their audience to read it, they will happily link to it. Many will accept, a lot will say no, and some won&#8217;t even respond. That is part of the game of link building.<\/p>\n<p>Another key way to proactively build links is to strategically guest post.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc65680086\"><\/a>3. Guest Post to boost your Domain Authority<\/h3>\n<p>Guest posting is when you write a piece that is to be published on a third party website instead of your own. A guest post is many times more efficient and effective at boosting your current DA score than only creating content on your native website is.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2587\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blog2-12.png\" alt=\"screenshot of example guest post page for the photography niche\" width=\"1195\" height=\"891\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With guest posting, you will have many opportunities to link your website in your content or Author Bio yourself. Studies have shown that people are more likely to click on links within a blog while they are still gaining information rather than afterwards, once they have captured said information.<\/p>\n<p>Both ways, however, provide a high quality backlink to your website from a reputable, high DA site that is sure to also boost your own DA. This is important because these links will be on high authority websites that you&#8217;ve found in your niche, showing Google that you are a thought leader in your industry.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, since the new people that will read your post are already interested in your niche, this further improves the chances of them coming to your blog and linking back to <em>your<\/em> posts.<\/p>\n<p>You can find guest posting websites by searching &#8220;*insert niche* guest posting websites&#8221; on Google.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2586\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blog2-11.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Google search to find relevant guest posting sites\" width=\"1042\" height=\"696\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yet another way is to locate them using key phrases such as &#8220;write for us&#8221;, &#8220;submit a post&#8221;, &#8220;submit a blog&#8221;, etc.<\/p>\n<p>A final note on guest posts is to make sure that the links being provided to you are &#8220;<strong><em>do follow<\/em><\/strong>&#8221; and not &#8220;<em>no follow<\/em>&#8220;. <u>A do follow link will help your rankings directly<\/u> by communicating the link to search engines, while a no follow link will not communicate this.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Pro Tip<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Since guest posting is a time intensive process, don&#8217;t mass produce content to be guest posted everywhere; instead, be more strategic about which websites will give you the biggest bang for your buck.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>While this information about no follow backlinks can persuade you to avoid no follow links altogether, chances are, you will get them at some point. There&#8217;s no need to remove them as long as they are from a relevant website in your niche.<\/p>\n<p>They still provide referral traffic (which influences your rankings), brand awareness, and greater social media shares and engagement. So while no follow links may not directly impact your rankings and DA, they do indirectly help so there\u2019s no harm to keep relevant no follow links as part of your website&#8217;s backlink portfolio.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc65680087\"><\/a>4. Build Domain Authority with Content Syndication<\/h3>\n<p>Content syndication is when you publish a singular piece of content on <em>multiple websites<\/em>. Note that this is separate from guest posting because, instead of creating entirely new content on a website, you are instead reposting it by giving the third party website permission to do so.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this on your own using blog posting websites like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.medium.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Medium<\/a>, and even forum websites such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Quora<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Reddit.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2585\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blog2-10.png\" alt=\"screenshot of LinkedIn blogs site where content can be reposted and linked back to your website to improve your backlinks and hence, Domain Authority\" width=\"1146\" height=\"890\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can also reach out to websites that will republish with your permission. To find these, search &#8220;republish with permission&#8221; and add the topic you are covering in your piece or even your niche as a whole so you can explore.<\/p>\n<p>When you do find these web sources where you can republish with permission, you want to reach out to them communicating the value their site will receive through republishing your specific content piece.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc65680088\"><\/a>5. Create high-value content that fellow bloggers will want to link to<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a reason we keep saying that <em><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/v1\/why-content-driven-seo-is-a-lucrative-digital-marketing-strategy-for-2019-and-beyond\/\">Content is King<\/a>. <\/u><\/em>That\u2019s because it truly is, fit with a bombastic gold crown and silver scepter.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2584\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blog2-9.png\" alt=\"A content marketer is typing on their laptop writing high-quality content to improve their website\u2019s SEO and Domain AuthorityA content marketer is typing on their laptop writing high-quality content to improve their website\u2019s SEO and Domain Authority\" width=\"962\" height=\"642\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The truth is, you can follow every single SEO advice and tactic in the proverbial book, but, ultimately, having good SEO clears the path for a site visitor to come to your content.

Trust leads to higher site visits, lower bounce rates, greater dwell time, and greater conversions. Yet another awesome benefit of creating high-quality content, though, is that authoritative blogs within your niche will also find it valuable.<\/p>\n<p>Because your blog explains, teaches, or provides some sort of resource to them in an easily digestible manner, they\u2019ll be incentivized to link back to your blog as a citation in one of their pieces.

The point of these fields is to show the text to the viewer about what\u2019s happening in the image in case it doesn\u2019t load, or your visitor is visually impaired.

This means using your target keywords naturally where they are relevant in your blog and web content.<\/p>\n<p>The more you place your keywords based on relevancy, the greater its readability becomes, and therefore, the longer your reader is likely to stay engaged.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc65680095\"><\/a>Use both internal and external links<\/h3>\n<p>Internal links are important because they create a web of interconnected pages on your website through links. The more coiled and well-connected the <em>web<\/em> is, the better Google\u2019s <em>Spiders <\/em>can crawl it.<\/p>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love a good spider pun?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2580\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blog2-5.png\" alt=\"A spider web is shown with a spider crawling it to illustrate that increasing internal links help Google's spiders crawl your website more easily, improving your domain authority.\" width=\"962\" height=\"642\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Internal links build a high-quality network between your web pages the Spiders can index on Google.<\/p>\n<p>Building internal links also helps you &#8220;pass on&#8221; some of the authority you&#8217;ve gained from a reputable page to other specific web pages on your site for which your goal is to rank.<\/p>\n<p>External links help when they are relevant because it shows you are linking to note-worthy blogs and websites related to your topics.

Fix up your Technical SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Your technical SEO is the foundation upon which your rankings, domain authority, and everything you&#8217;re doing for your website, stand on. You need to have your website registered on Google Search Console. Once you&#8217;ve registered, submit a file known as the &#8220;xml sitemap&#8221; of your website to Google Search Console.<\/p>\n<p>This is the equivalent of giving Google a &#8220;cheat sheet&#8221; map to send its crawlers through your website. You want these crawlers all over your website because once they are, they can index your web pages.<\/p>\n<p>Indexing your pages means that they become part of the Google Search results. Once you&#8217;ve completed these steps, you can actually test your pages for crawlability.<\/p>\n<p>This can be done using the Fetch tool within Google Search Console. The <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2011\/08\/submit-urls-to-google-with-fetch-as\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Fetch as Google bot<\/a> feature in your Google Search Console dashboard allows you to submit new and updated URLs to Google for sped-up indexing and to check whether your site pages can be crawled by Google&#8217;s bots.<\/p>\n<p>To check the status of existing pages that you&#8217;ve already been in the process of indexing, you can use Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/9012289\" rel=\"nofollow\">URL Inspection Tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2579\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blog2-4.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of a Google tool to help with technical SEO and heighten domain authority\" width=\"962\" height=\"395\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Crawlability problems, in particular, are frustrating because they mean that even if all the right elements on your website are in place, you are still missing out on some SEO juice that can impact your domain authority score.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, it&#8217;s important to regularly audit your website for crawlability problems including problematic redirects, links that don&#8217;t work, 404 pages, irrelevant or outdated content links, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Another major focus area to improve your DA should be social signals.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc65680097\"><\/a>9. Social Signals<\/h3>\n<p>Social signals are social media engagements and shares. They\u2019re important because they indicate to Google that your content is creating buzz and is relevant within your niche.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2578\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/blog2-3.png\" alt=\"Worldwide social media penetration statistics to demonstrate its importance in the world today and how it can be instrumental in bettering a website's Domain Authority\" width=\"958\" height=\"651\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While Google has maintained that Social Signals are not an official ranking factor, there\u2019s a huge correlation between pages that rank well and their social media presences.
