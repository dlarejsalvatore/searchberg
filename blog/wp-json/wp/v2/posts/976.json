It\u2019s unparalleled. It\u2019s undisputed and its unmatched because no other search engine even comes close to offering the level of information and accuracy that Google does.<\/p>\n<p>But what makes Google so powerful, so accurate and so reliable?<\/p>\n<p>Its <em>user-focused<\/em> algorithms!<\/p>\n<p>Google algorithms simply leave no page unturned (*pun intended*) when it comes to providing internet users (like us) with a matchless search experience. If a page is ranked high on Google, it\u2019s because the algorithms have found it authoritative, important, reliable and most importantly, relevant to the user\u2019s search query and most likely to lead to a positive search experience.<\/p>\n<p>To gauge websites across all these parameters, Google assess them on multiple ranking factors. One such ranking factor is links or the number of \u201cbacklinks\u201d indexed to the page to be more specific.<\/p>\n<p>Think of backlinks as references in the offline world.<\/p>\n<p>In the offline world, companies and individuals endorse and promote various products and services. The more different types and number of recommendations, the more popular that brand becomes.<\/p>\n<p>Same is the case here.<\/p>\n<p>Backlinks are a recommendations or citation for a webpage. The websites and social media profiles backlinking to the webpage are the media, companies and the people.<\/p>\n<p>When a webpage has more backlinks coming from quality sources, Google considers that page of high value. Consequently, Google ranks that page higher in the SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>The process of acquiring backlinks for a webpage is known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/link-building-service.html\">link building<\/a>; a very popular and in-demand digital marketing service today.<\/p>\n<p>Some common ways to build backlinks to a webpage (or website) include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Link requests<\/strong>, where the website administrator simply asks other admins of other websites to link back to their webpage. They may agree as is, or they may ask for a reciprocating backlink in favor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Leveraging online directories<\/strong>, where web admins create free listings and build backlinks to their webpages. It\u2019s similar to link buying, but it\u2019s not considered a \u201cbad link buying\u201d practice as per Google\u2019s guidelines.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Guest blogging<\/strong>, where you submit a blog or article to another website and create backlinks via the submitted content piece.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Creating high-value content<\/strong>, where you create content that is truly unique, acting as an authority (and reference-worthy) content piece on the subject of discussion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Through link building, SEO expect generate web traffic, brand awareness, search engine rankings and higher web page visibility and higher domain or page authority.<\/p>\n<p>However not all links are created equal and over the years, focus has shifted from building links to earning links. SEO\u2019s today have a much better understanding of how search engines work and what entails a good link building process.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, web admins and SEO experts have started focusing more on <em>earning<\/em> backlinks than <em>building<\/em> them.<\/p>\n<p>Anna Crowe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/link-building-guide\/guide-link-building-link-earning\/\">writes<\/a> for Search Engine Journal:<\/p>\n<p>To build a high-quality, credible backlink profile, you need to stop working on building links and start working on earning links.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What\u2019s the difference between Link Building and Link Earning<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The concept is same, to get more backlinks to your website or webpage. However, link earning specifically focuses on establishing generic associations as opposed to establishing reciprocated or paid associations.<\/p>\n<p>Link earning is like a subset of link building.<\/p>\n<p>Since you\u2019re seeking generic associations in link earning, the only link building technique which then remains relevant in the context is creating high value content. If you create high value, authority content, website administrators are likely to cite your content on their webpage or website. This way you get to generically generate backlinks for your webpage. Readers who end up on your page also acknowledge the content as worthy of earning backlinks, and it enables them to see it through their skepticism and appreciate the information.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Creating High Value Linkable Content <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>So how to create high value linkable content?<\/p>\n<p>It all starts with a strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself: What theme would you like to have for your content? Does the theme align with your business goals? Is the theme relevant to your target audience? How strongly it resonates with their problems?<\/p>\n<p>These questions will help you create a strategy for your content.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a strategy in place, the next step is to research the facts and information. Study everything there is to be studied about the topic.<\/p>\n<p>Using the gathered information from your research, create a compelling content for your audience. Use visuals where possible. Bake in the resources. Maintain clarity. Discuss your point comprehensively. Spoon feed them. One thing to note is that quality viral content doesn\u2019t have to come in the shape of a blog. There are many avenues you can pursue. Make a short video about a product you are selling. Create a visually stunning infographic on the benefits of a particular service that your business is offering. Make your content standout. It doesn\u2019t have to be a blog post<\/p>\n<p>In addition, you can promote your content through influencers and industry leaders. Of course, they won\u2019t just facilitate your request (as they\u2019ve a reputation to maintain), so you\u2019ll have to work towards building a partnership with them first. You\u2019ll have to earn their trust to convince them to promote your content. This will further help you generate more backlinks to your web page.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Hire Search Berg for Link Building Services<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In this age of content skeptics and critics, link building is all about link earning links through quality content!<\/p>\n<p>Do you run a business that needs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/small-business-seo.html\">online presence<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>Looking to monetize your site through quality link building and link earning techniques?<\/p>\n<p>Do you want your product or service pages to rank on the first in Google?<\/p>\n<p>Search Berg is at your service!<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re one of the leading digital marketing service providers in the United States.
