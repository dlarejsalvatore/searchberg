Earn Local Backlinks From Websites With High Domain Authority<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Link building is undeniably one of the most effective ways to get your business on the map.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, link building is the process of acquiring backlinks from third-party websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if a non-competitor in your industry links to your content or product\/service pages, you earn a backlink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is this important?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earning a valuable backlink from a website with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/high-domain-authority\/\">high domain authority<\/a> is a surefire way to attract quality traffic. As their readers are redirected to your content, you\u2019ll successfully manage to tap into a wide audience base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this means more revenue, it also means higher chances of breaking into the Google 3-Pack in the long run!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/10-advanced-link-building-tips-and-tricks-to-boost-your-seo\/\">advanced link building tips and tricks<\/a> to help you get started!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Create a Mobile-Friendly Website<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1659\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/13.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/local-seo-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\">78%<\/a> of all local mobile searches result in a purchase. As smartphones become the epicenter of the modern world, creating a mobile-friendly website is imperative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your website isn\u2019t <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/responsive-mobile-design\/\">mobile-friendly<\/a>, you\u2019ll fail to target the large majority of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We suggest opting for clean yet appealing graphics, user-friendliness, and eye-catching CTAs (call-to-actions).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1660\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/14.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, mobile-friendliness also helps Google determine the quality and legitimacy of your business. If your website isn\u2019t mobile-friendly, there\u2019s no reason for Google to include it in the 3-Pack. The last thing Google wants is to receive negative feedback from customers who interacted with a business in the 3-Pack that didn\u2019t have a mobile-friendly website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10.
