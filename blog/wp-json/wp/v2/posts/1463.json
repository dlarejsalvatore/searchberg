As people engage with the review, they\u2019re also more likely to form a negative opinion about the brand, thereby feeling less inclined to invest in their products\/services in the future.<\/p>\n<p>However, timely detection and a tactful response by the brand can undo a lot of potential damage.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Apple\u2019s assiduous and prompt response resulted in the customer following up their tweet with:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1472\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"587\" height=\"259\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While the aforementioned interaction is a great way to strengthen brand identity and appease customers, most brands remain in the dark about negative reviews, thereby running the risk of damaging brand reputation.<\/p>\n<p>This is where <strong>reputation management services <\/strong>step in.<\/p>\n<p>By conscientiously examining a brand\u2019s\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbeslacouncil\/2019\/03\/04\/five-ways-to-build-a-strong-online-presence-for-your-brand\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">digital presence<\/a><\/u>, reputation repair experts ensure timely remedial action. As a fundamental component of reputation management, social media monitoring increases conversion rates, audience retention, revenue growth, net promoter score, website traffic, and customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>Still skeptical about leveraging reputation management to boost your business?<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve rounded up eight reasons to benefit from reputation management services during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Reduce Customer Attrition<\/h2>\n<p>According to Forbes, over\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ryanerskine\/2018\/07\/30\/study-97-of-business-owners-say-online-reputation-management-is-important-heres-how-to-keep-up\/#763a2c996c02\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">97%<\/a><\/u>\u00a0of business owners across the U.S. attribute their strong brand presence to\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/repairing-your-company-reputation\/\">active reputation management<\/a><\/u>. The reason? Reduced customer attrition.<\/p>\n<p>With social media usage expected to hit an all-time high in the following months, people are increasingly sharing reviews on personal and professional platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, and\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/how-to-optimize-google-my-business-listing-and-leverage-it-for-more-sales\/\">Google My Business<\/a><\/u>. Messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have also increased in popularity owing to the ongoing lockdown.<\/p>\n<p>The consequent increase in negative reviews, false allegations, and factually inaccurate information can increase customer attrition rates, thereby affecting sales and diminishing brand credibility.<\/p>\n<p>Reputation repair and management services play a fundamental role in improving brand perception by suppressing damaging and unfavorable content, thereby preventing customers from seeking competitors instead.<\/p>\n<p>By concurrently utilizing response and removal strategies, reputation management services also help brands reduce the chances of an expansive digital altercation that could potentially attract attention for undesirable reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Response strategies focus on crafting an empathetic, apologetic, and remedial response to the customer\u2019s concerns.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1473\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"593\" height=\"536\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Nike\u2019s timely response\u2014within the same day\u2014is a great example of a strong reputation management response strategy. Instead of drafting an objectively remedial response, they engage with the customer subjectively, thereby establishing a virtual connection.<\/p>\n<p>Not only does this rectify the customer\u2019s concerns, but it gives potential customers a glimpse of the brand\u2019s empathetic and prompt engagement.<\/p>\n<p>While many brands tend to conflate customer service with reputation management, the latter undertakes an exhaustive and all-encompassing digital search to identify negative reviews on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social networks (Twitter, et al.)<\/li>\n<li>Search engines (Google, et al.)<\/li>\n<li>Review sites (Google My Business, Yelp, et al.)<\/li>\n<li>Online video-sharing platforms (YouTube, et al.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The methodical comprehensiveness ensures maximum engagement, thereby generating a positive brand reputation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1474\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"131\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Collectively, these measures minimize customer attrition at the height of digital interaction.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Build Customer Trust, Credibility, and Loyalty during a Period of Uncertainty and Anxiety<\/h2>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has gripped people with fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. As the situation continues to deteriorate across the nation, people are actively seeking support, motivation, and encouragement from friends, family, and brands.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1475\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"622\" height=\"415\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Trusted brands have some key traits, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Empathy<\/strong> &#8211; They even go as far as rather than having an us vs. them approach, they adopt the opposite: an us = them approach. Because of this approach on the brand&#8217;s part, customers find it easy to think of themselves as aligned with the values and priorities of a company.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Transparency<\/strong> &#8211; This consists not only of sharing information accurately and in the right amount but also phrasing said messages in an appropriate manner for the subject matter.<\/li>\n<li>They connect through <strong>shared values<\/strong> &#8211; Shared values indicate a level of consistency in the brand&#8217;s approach. The content may change, the pandemic may evolve, and time may bring new challenges every passing day, but the morals of the company will stay consistent. This consistency builds trust with a customer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When trust is in this way built at the highest of levels between the customer and the brand, there are strong emotions tied to the customer&#8217;s investment into the company.<\/p>\n<p>Lending your support by engaging with not-so-great reviews and comments in a friendly and empathetic manner will help customers feel positive and affirmed during a period of increasing chaos.<\/p>\n<p>Building customer trust, credibility, and loyalty will also strengthen your brand identity.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Boost Digital Lead Generation (and Sales!)<\/h2>\n<p>Struggling to generate more leads for your business amid the ongoing pandemic?<\/p>\n<p>You can boost your lead generation efforts using reputation management. Since reputation management allows you to stay in the loop on what conversations are being had about your brand on social media, use this knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>Using active <strong>social listening<\/strong>, you can identify:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>People that are seeking product\/service recommendations akin to what you are offering<\/u><\/strong>. Then, very simply, recommend your product to them in a way that shows them it meets their needs.<\/li>\n<li><strong><u>Unsatisfied customers who have used your competitor&#8217;s product\/service<\/u><\/strong>. If you&#8217;re aware that your product instead can actually help them, directly engage with them in conversation and tell them why. You can also share a useful blog post you made that helps them with their specific or even a lead magnet with good information, which would lead them into your sales funnel.<\/li>\n<li><strong><u>People who are intrigued by your product or service specifically<\/u><\/strong>. Finding consumer questions and inquiries as soon as they appear on the internet and responding to them helps you provide a very streamlined and high-quality customer experience, both for potential and current customers. This service incentivizes them to go on to or to continue using your product or service.<\/li>\n<li><strong><u>Relevant influencers who can help you attract more customers<\/u><\/strong>. Many are surprised that it&#8217;s not necessarily the biggest influencer that can help your brand but the one with the most relevance to your product\/service. By interacting with such influencers, not only do you discover them but also figure out how you can work together to promote your brand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Reputation management companies also offer SEO services, paid search marketing, and social media marketing, thereby\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/lead-generation.html\">maximizing lead generation<\/a><\/u>. As your Google rankings are improved, you\u2019ll notice an increase in customer attraction, engagement, and retention.<\/p>\n<p>While most businesses initially consult reputation management services to strengthen their online presence, this synchronous benefit ends up ensuring long-term holistic business growth.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Improve Search Engine Rankings<\/h2>\n<p>Online reviews play a significant role in SEO.<\/p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/online-reputation-management-and-seo-is-there-a-link\/\">SEO reputation management strategies<\/a><\/u>\u2014including link development, researching appropriate link partners, and running branded PPC ads, among others\u2014<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/the-importance-of-seo-services-for-your-website\/\">increase SEO visibility<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>This enhances customer experience and increases sales, especially during a period when most brands are struggling to maintain KPIs.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Understand Evolving Customer Needs and Expectations<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1476\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"628\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 has caused a massive shift in customer needs and expectations. While brands were previously focused on engaging with audiences through their products and services, there has been an increase in the need to establish customer relations by lending support during the ongoing crisis.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of circling back to marketing and selling, more and more businesses are helping customers feel\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.globaltrademag.com\/how-businesses-can-weather-covid-19-start-with-empathy-to-employees\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">acknowledged and validated<\/a><\/u>\u00a0as the lockdown, and consequent fear surrounding COVID-19 continue.<\/p>\n<p>Utilizing reputation management tools is a great way to establish meaningful connections with customers, thereby understanding their evolving needs and expectations. For instance, most travel businesses understand that their customers aren\u2019t seeking their services at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>However, this shouldn\u2019t halt customer communication in the least. Instead, reorienting strategies in accordance with the changes helps customers feel comforted, thereby increasing the likelihood of a positive customer-business relationship in the future.<\/p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/reputation-management.html\">Reputation management services<\/a><\/u>\u00a0play a foundational role in responding to negative and positive feedback alike, thereby cultivating a genuine connection with the customer that goes beyond a temporary transaction.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Develop an Empathetic, Responsible, and Crisis-Sensitive Digital Customer Communication Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>While some brands have struck a fine balance between retaining metrics and <strong>engaging with customers in a responsible manner<\/strong>, there are many others that are struggling to traverse this tricky terrain.<\/p>\n<p>While you may feel tempted to give in to a company&#8217;s <strong>capitalist roots<\/strong> and create solely promotional and\/or sales-y content, you might want to reevaluate this decision.<\/p>\n<p>The COVID 19 crisis demands that we move away from unadulterated branding and instead prioritize a more <strong>empathetic, human tone to brand messaging. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Providing helpful and supportive messages can&#8230; well, help an audience feel <strong><em>supported<\/em><\/strong>! Especially in this time of immense uncertainty and chaos.<\/p>\n<p>Try to remember, <em>people&#8217;s lives have been turned upside down.<\/em> So they might view an overly promotional post as downright <em>insensitive<\/em> of a brand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Change your messaging to <\/strong>reflect this shift towards a more &#8220;<strong>humanized marketing approach,<\/strong>&#8221; centering on the health of your audience. Showing that you care about holistically supporting your audience&#8217;s physical, social and mental health will place you as a thought leader and will ultimately serve to help build wider trust with your brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re unsure about how to draft an effective and crisis-sensitive digital customer communication strategy, it may be best to consult professionals. Responding to customers in an unsupportive and dismissive manner can cause long-term damage to your brand\u2019s reputation, especially given the sensitivity of the ongoing pandemic.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Strengthen Brand Visibility and Identity<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most favorable benefits of protecting and managing your brand\u2019s online reputation, especially during COVID 19, is\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescoachescouncil\/2019\/04\/25\/13-effective-methods-to-help-you-build-a-strong-brand-identity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ensuring strong brand visibility and identity<\/a><\/u>. This is especially important if your company has run into issues with customers, clients, and employees in the past.<\/p>\n<p>If these issues become public, reputation management is imperative.<\/p>\n<p>By taking strong measures to correct past explosive blunders and meticulously protecting present brand identity, reputation repair experts help businesses avoid stagnancy, or even their downfall. Companies like\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/tdwi.org\/articles\/2018\/10\/29\/biz-all-impact-of-equifax-data-breach.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Equifax<\/a><\/u>\u00a0and\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/10\/11\/here-are-5-things-sears-got-wrong-that-sped-its-fall.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sears<\/a><\/u>\u00a0are still notorious for their abysmal reputation because they couldn\u2019t save face and put up a strong front.<\/p>\n<p>Remedial measures can go a long way in helping brands stay afloat and tackle the damage\u2014especially if it was caused by an online smear campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Increase Chances of Remotely Recruiting Top-Tier Candidates<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1477\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"628\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 has\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/poetsandquants\/2020\/03\/29\/how-covid-19-is-crashing-on-the-class-of-2020-job-offers-already-disappearing\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reduced\u2014and even halted\u2014<\/a><\/u>recruitment across the nation.

As candidates actively research potential workplaces, they\u2019re very likely to stumble upon unanswered customer complaints, disconcerting interactions, and an unfriendly brand demeanor.<\/p>\n<p>This could easily take your company off the map, thereby further reducing the chances of successful remote recruitment. To ensure a seamless online presence for potential employees, clients, and customers alike, take strong measures to reduce negative media coverage, take down hate sites, and respond to negative reviews in a corrective, assistive, and cheerful manner.<\/p>\n<p>In case of a serious attack on your brand reputation, we recommend consulting professionals to undertake an online investigation. In addition, false reviews with improper language or misleading information can be easily taken down.<\/p>\n<p>Actively monitor the online comments being made about your brand\u2014the good and the bad. This strategy will also help you familiarize yourself with prominent brand weaknesses that are being brought up by multiple customers.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of taking strict measures to take constructive criticism down, engaging with it in a thoughtful manner and learning from it to better your brand can go a long way in ensuring customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1478\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"628\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As one of the leading digital marketing service providers across the U.S., we offer\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/reputation-management.html\">expert reputation management services<\/a><\/u>\u2014including new domain and platform creation for link suppression, Google-friendly link building, and active response and removal.<\/p>\n<p>Browse through our award-winning PPC marketing,\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/social-media-management.html\">social media management<\/a><\/u>,\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/content-marketing.html\">content marketing<\/a><\/u>, and web design and development services to choose the best package for your business.
