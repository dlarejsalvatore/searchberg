Some certainly take time to implement and have an incubation period to garner results such as SEO and Content Marketing.<\/p>\n<p>The<strong> fastest <\/strong>way to market all around, though, resoundingly, is <strong><u>PPC&#8211;AKA Pay Per Click Advertising<\/u>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While you may be somewhat familiar with paid advertising and how to become a Google Ads specialist, you may not know what PPC is specifically. Basically, it\u2019s a <strong>paid advertising model for use in Search Engines<\/strong>. In this model, you <strong>only pay every time someone clicks on your ad<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As a bonus, if someone saw your ad and became<strong> aware <\/strong>of your brand but doesn\u2019t click it,<strong> you don\u2019t have to pay for that impression<\/strong>. Since people who saw your ad are now aware of your brand, they\u2019re automatically<em> more likely to click on it <\/em>the next time that they see your ad.<\/p>\n<p><em>Pretty cool, right?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Learning how to set up PPC ad campaigns in Google can be very lucrative because <em>most online consumers <\/em><em><u>do<\/u><\/em> click on Google Ads when they\u2019re shopping online. And unlike unpaid marketing methods such as SEO, which can take months to yield impressions, clicks, and conversions, <strong><em>PPC yields immediate results<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>But because you don\u2019t want to blow your ad budget on a not-so-great ad that doesn\u2019t actually give you the conversions and click-throughs you desire, it\u2019s crucial to <u>create a solid plan for your PPC campaign<\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>Having a good, thought-through plan also helps you <u>reduce your ad spend<\/u>. This is because the <strong>more relevant <\/strong>your ad is to your target audience\u2019s search keywords, the more a search engine like Google will<strong> reward you with a lower ad cost.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google wants to connect the right ad with an audience that would appreciate it, so they reward the advertisers and businesses that play the game well and according to their rules.<\/p>\n<p>Use our simple guide to make sure you both have a<strong><u> successful campaign<\/u><\/strong>, and search engines reward it so you can <strong><u>lower your costs.<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"blog-cta style3\">\n<h3>Setting up your PPC campaign can skyrocket your marketing efforts!

To have a successful campaign, you can\u2019t use just any random keywords. You need to look into<em> who <\/em>your customer is, <em>what <\/em>they want,and most importantly,<em> how <\/em>they\u2019re searching for those wants in search engines.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s actually a built-in <strong>keyword searching tool within Google Adwords<\/strong> that you can utilize for this purpose. The tool will ask you for<em> \u201cseed words or phrases.\u201d<\/em> These will be terms you think your ideal customer will search for.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-46.png\" alt=\"Google Ads Keyword Searching Tool For pay per click guide\" width=\"828\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>How are you supposed to know what they are searching for?<\/p>\n<p>One way is to make detailed <em>customer personas <\/em>using the data you have available. Your first list will be everything that you <em>think<\/em> your <strong>ideal customer<\/strong> is looking for. Then, later on, when you\u2019re running campaigns, you can refine this list using the polishing strategy that\u2019s <strong>A\/B testing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>A\/B testing is essentially <u>testing different versions of your ad<\/u> (version A, B, C, etc.) to see which version gets a greater, more efficient response from your target audience. When you know what\u2019s working in your tests, you do more of that for better results.<\/p>\n<p>When you input your<strong> \u201cseed phrases\u201d<\/strong> into Google Adwords, it will spit out a bunch of related keywords that people are searching for alongside their average monthly search volumes and cost per click, among other values. You definitely don\u2019t need to consider them all. The main ones are the <strong>monthly search volume, how competitive each keyword is, and their estimated cost per click. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This handy dandy tool also spits out <em>\u201crelated\u201d keywords <\/em>that you may not have even thought of but might want to consider looking into using for your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Another <strong><u>fun fact<\/u><\/strong>: you can specifically target your keywords and <strong><u>get the data for a specific location<\/u><\/strong> that you want to advertise in. For example, if you only want to advertise in specific regions in New York, you can narrow the data you get for search volumes in those places to see what the people in those places\u2019 <em>search patterns <\/em>are like.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you have a whole bunch of juicy, raw data, you can take it and <strong>organize it <\/strong>into specific categories for your ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blog-cta style3\">\n<h3>Struggling to understand how setting up a PPC campaign can skyrocket your marketing efforts?

When you put them in groups like this that are similar, these groups are called <strong>Ad Groups.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The more specific your Ad Groups become, the easier it will become for you to <em><u>create an ad tying all of those keywords together<\/u><\/em> because they already fit together naturally.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re organizing your keywords, you want to keep in mind that users may have varying <strong>intentions <\/strong>when they\u2019re looking for products or services online. Some may search with the intention to<strong> gather information,<\/strong> while others may search for a term with the intention to purchase. The good thing is that you can look at keywords and discern what the searcher\u2019s likely intention is.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this by reading the word and analyzing what might be going through someone\u2019s mind when searching that word or phrase into Google. <u>Shorter,<\/u> one or two-word keywords are generally <u>information seeking<\/u> in nature.<\/p>\n<p>For example: <strong><em>\u201cglue gun\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Compare this with the search term<strong><em> \u201cglue gun cost near me\u201d <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Looking at the second keyword, you can tell that the second searcher is far more likely to purchase a glue gun rather than simply gather information about a glue gun, what it is, how it works, etc.<\/p>\n<p>You can still use either or both keywords, depending on<strong> what your campaign goal <\/strong>is. If your goal is to get<strong> more sales<\/strong>, it would make sense to put greater emphasis on \u201cglue gun cost near me\u201d as opposed to just \u201cglue gun.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But if your goal is<strong> brand recognition<\/strong> or just getting your business\u2019s name out there, you might be able to use both keywords because they both fit that purpose.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for further information regarding how to use the internet to build your personal and business brand, be sure to check out two of our blogs on brand building:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/10-ways-to-build-a-strong-personal-reputation-for-individuals-and-entrepreneurs\/\"><strong>10 Ways to Build a Strong Personal Reputation For Individuals and Entrepreneurs<\/strong><\/a> and<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/how-to-build-a-good-reputation-for-your-business-that-will-entice-viewers-and-create-a-positive-brand-image\/\"><strong>How to Build A Good Reputation for Your Business That Will Entice Viewers and Create A Positive Brand Image<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc21899\"><\/a>Phase 3: Check Out Your Competition<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you have many assorted keywords organized by Ad Groups, you want to <em>test them out <\/em>and <em>see what kind of ads come up<\/em> when you search them. This will lead you to see ads from your competitors and will be instrumental in your approach because you can spy on what kind of ads they\u2019re running.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2507\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog3.jpg\" alt=\"Guide to PPC Competition Keyword Research\" width=\"977\" height=\"385\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This also helps you gauge whether the keyword is good. Suppose you see<strong> many businesses competing<\/strong> over that keyword, <strong>but they\u2019re not within your niche<\/strong>. In this case, that keyword might not be right for you, and there\u2019s no sense in spending good money from your Ad Budget on it.<\/p>\n<p><em>So scrap it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, if relevant competitors are fighting over a keyword, you know it\u2019s a good keyword that you want to also get in on.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use free tools to watch your competition\u2019s performance, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spyfu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Spyfu<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc11837\"><\/a>Pro Tip: Look into Negative Keywords<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Negative Keywords are keywords that you don\u2019t want to show up in search results for<\/strong>, even if they\u2019re related to your niche. An example of this would be a keyword that\u2019s related to your niche but doesn\u2019t relate to your product. This could look like the use of the word<em> \u201cfree\u201d<\/em> in a keyword when you\u2019re trying to make sales.<\/p>\n<p>Using the goal of making sales, it would not be a great match to connect with a customer who\u2019s looking for free items rather than to pay. Therefore, you can put the word \u201cfree\u201d as a negative keyword. That way, if someone searches for this keyword in addition to a word or phrase in your keyword list, <strong>Google knows not to show your ad to this person<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This is great because it ultimately<strong> saves you money<\/strong> on pointless impressions and clicks that aren\u2019t a match for both parties to begin with.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc21223\"><\/a>Phase 4: Create PPC Ads<\/h2>\n<p>There are three main components for how to set up your PPC campaign:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The headline<\/li>\n<li>The description<\/li>\n<li>The Display URL<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You have limited character space for your <em>headline and description,<\/em> so make sure to <strong>take full advantage <\/strong>of the real-estate space the search engine provides you with for the headline and description.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>display URL<\/em> is basically for aesthetic purposes. The ad would go to your landing page that you put into the ad as the \u201c<u>final URL,<\/u>\u201d but the display URL appears on the search engine in the ad itself when your prospect is looking at it.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from Text Ads (also known as <strong>Search Ads<\/strong>), you have the option of choosing:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Display Ads, which consists of text, image,\u00a0<strong>video<\/strong>, audio, and motion\u00a0<strong>ads<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Remarketing Ads<\/li>\n<li>Google Shopping<\/li>\n<li>Gmail Sponsored Ads<\/li>\n<li>Social Ads<\/li>\n<li>Local Service Ads &amp;<\/li>\n<li>Instream Ads<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For further information regarding video ads, in particular, be sure to check out our video on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4Fk48tDAVCQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Using Video Marketing to Maximize Traffic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Whichever Ad type you use, you will have to <strong>write words to entice your audience <\/strong>to click on them and become part of your <strong>sales funnel<\/strong>. These words make up your ad copy.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc1771\"><\/a>Description &amp; Headline: PPC Ad Copy That Converts<\/h3>\n<p>What people love to click on is<strong> content that\u2019s personalized <\/strong>for them. If you address their <strong>specific pain points and concerns<\/strong>, your prospect will feel seen and validated and therefore is more likely to engage with your ad over others.<\/p>\n<p>Your <strong>keyword research and customer profile<\/strong> will help you understand why your customer would be searching for the terms that you are targeting. What\u2019s the<strong> underlying concern<\/strong> they want to resolve or need that they are trying to meet?<\/p>\n<p>In your <em>Ad Copy<\/em>, you want to emphasize <strong><u>how your product\/company\/business meets the need that this user is searching for<\/u><\/strong>. This is your <strong><u>unique selling proposition or USP<\/u><\/strong>. So you want to <strong><u>include your USP clearly where you can in your Ad<\/u><\/strong> to put it where your prospects can see.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc11198\"><\/a>Final URL: Have a Solid Landing Page for When Your Prospect Clicks Your Ad<\/h3>\n<p>A <strong>solid landing page<\/strong> is a <strong>relevant landing page<\/strong>. Basically, whatever you promise the prospect in your PPC ad itself, you want the landing page that they click on to be relevant to what the ad said. The landing page should<strong> bridge a gap and help solve the same problem<\/strong> with your USP that the ad had summarized for them earlier in the search engine.<\/p>\n<p>An aesthetically appealing landing page is nothing without relevance. That being said,<strong> a good design<\/strong> doesn\u2019t hurt once you have the relevance down.<\/p>\n<p>By creating really specific landing pages tailored for your ads, you essentially <strong>eliminate any extra work a lead may have to do<\/strong> in navigating your site. Less work means less tedious scrolling to navigate your site, which means more time spent digesting <strong><em>why your product and your unique selling point solves their problem<\/em><\/strong><em>. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>This efficient allotment of time spent, in turn, increases your<strong> conversion rate in the PPC campaign you have run<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you have a good idea about running a campaign, let\u2019s look at the best platforms that you can use to run these awesome campaigns on.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc14305\"><\/a>Top PPC Platforms<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2506\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-45.png\" alt=\"concept illustration top PPC platforms\" width=\"970\" height=\"783\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc22420\"><\/a>Google Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Google is a giant and by far the largest search engine on the planet.

So use it to find your target audience because if it\u2019s not on a platform as universal and all-encompassing as Google, it\u2019s likely not anywhere else on the internet.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc20569\"><\/a>Bing Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Bing is also a good platform that you can run PPC campaigns on. The benefit here is that Bing is cheaper to run ads on in terms of cost per click (CPC), but it\u2019s no Google. The audience and reach is definitely smaller for Bing.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc12766\"><\/a>Facebook Advertising<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook Ads is super great for narrowing down to a very specific audience demographic because you can pick out pages, ideas, and topics that have proven interesting in the past.
