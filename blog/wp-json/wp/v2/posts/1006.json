It was informative and rather funny at its core. Everyone loved playing with it. However, at no stage was it considered a major impactful technology. Or atleast, that is how we perceived its present (now past) and future.<\/p>\n<p>Things have changed and turned out to be different.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Siri, or more specifically, voice assistant technology has become ingrained in the fabric of our daily lives. We have been introduced to its various other forms: Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant.People are using voice assistants to perform almost all their routine tasks\u2013 from setting up reminders to making calls to taking important notes.<\/p>\n<p>But one application that truly stands out is voice-assisted search.<\/p>\n<p>Voice search queries have become a major trend. They are dominating all platforms: tablets, smartphones, laptops and computers.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/ByronDeeter\/state-of-the-cloud-2017-72021644\">Bessemer Venture Partners<\/a>, 20% of all mobile search queries are made through voice assistants.<\/p>\n<p>Google also acknowledges this.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking at <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingland.com\/google-io-177651\">Google I\/O conference<\/a>, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that one-fifth of the queries on Google are made through voice search. The <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@marchick\/the-2017-voice-report-by-alpine-fka-voicelabs-24c5075a070f\">high number<\/a> of voice-first devices in circulation are a further evidence to established (and increasing) prominence and popularity of voice search.<\/p>\n<p>Why is the technology so prominent and popular? The reason is simple: Because of its convenience. Typing a search query takes time. Not to mention, there\u2019s always the chance of a misspelling.<\/p>\n<p>Performing a voice search on the other hand is more convenient.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to type; you only have to speak through the microphone and the technology does the rest for you with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/research\/blog\/microsoft-researchers-achieve-new-conversational-speech-recognition-milestone\/?tduid=(1692d313ad4cd94b450c08e090b3189b)(266696)(1503186)(72705X1553005X7a2f617fe5d4f09ec274e2411b1ed9b2)()&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID681541_aff_7593_1211691&amp;tduid=(ir_QaQ2IOVeE1Y8yzq3BLz3nwe0Ukj14YVSyTdOSs0)(7593)(1211691)(TnL5HPStwNw-8VyHyvi9bciR2T0W4lAM0w)(ir)&amp;clickid=QaQ2IOVeE1Y8yzq3BLz3nwe0Ukj14YVSyTdOSs0&amp;ircid=7593\">amazing accuracy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, it\u2019s faster than typing.<\/p>\n<p>This begs the question: Is your content optimized for voice search?<\/p>\n<h2><strong>It\u2019s all about creating a relevant acontent strategy<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>To produce voice search optimized content, you need a relevant strategy. This strategy will be a part of your overall <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/content-marketing.html\">content marketing<\/a> strategy.<\/p>\n<p>The steps to creating a content strategy that produces voice search optimized content are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the common questions consumers are most likely to ask<\/li>\n<li>Highlight which of those questions are more interesting to your business<\/li>\n<li>Come up with a set of closely related questions<\/li>\n<li>Address the targeted questions in a single cohesive article<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Identifying market-specific questions shouldn\u2019t be a problem for you if you already leverage content marketing for your business. Where you may struggle, however, is short listing questions that are more interesting to your business. When shortlisting target questions for producing voice search optimized content, focus on ones that capture <em>micro moments<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>What are micro moments?<\/p>\n<p>Micro moments are defined as windows of opportunities where a customer is ready to try, commit or buy. What makes micro moments so significant here is the fact that voice searches are more definitive in terms of action than traditional searches.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it: When was the last time you voice searched something like \u201cFunny videos\u201d or \u201cTop tips to so and so\u201d or something similar?<\/p>\n<p>Usually, when customers perform a voice search, they\u2019re doing it because they\u2019re in a hurry. Their intentions are more refined and defined.\u00a0 They are more prepared to spend money on a product or service. Their queries often start along the lines of <em>I-want-to-know<\/em>, <em>I-want-to-do<\/em>, <em>I-want-to-go <\/em>and <em>I-want-to-buy <\/em>nature. They are usually at more advanced stages in the marketing and sales funnels. They exhibit a greater tendency for micro moments and these are the very moments you need to target.<\/p>\n<p>But how can one capture these critical moments through their content, you ask?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where keywords come in.<\/p>\n<p>When we are talking about using keywords for producing voice-search optimized content, the focus should be on long tail keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, voice search queries are very specific and detailed. You won\u2019t find the generic \u2018buy jackets\u2019 queries with voice-assisted queries. Instead, they\u2019re more likely to use something like \u2019buy black leather jacket\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>This inherent nature of voice search queries makes the use of long tail keywords imperative.<\/p>\n<p>Also, it\u2019s vital to optimize the use of keywords according to the search intent of consumer.<\/p>\n<p>After the Hummingbird update, Google has started placing strong emphasis on user intent when interpreting search queries. It prefers returning content that employs keywords in the context of the search intent of the user.<\/p>\n<p>This applies even more strongly to voice search.<\/p>\n<p>For example, consider the keyword \u201cdigital marketing\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>It can have different contextual meanings depending onthe nature of a search query:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is <em>digital marketing<\/em>?<\/li>\n<li>What are the business benefits of <em>digital marketing<\/em>?<\/li>\n<li>How does <em>digital marketing<\/em> work?<\/li>\n<li>How to hire a <em>digital marketing<\/em> company?<\/li>\n<li>Where to find a <em>digital marketing<\/em> company in Alabama?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Assuming that your \u201c<strong>What is Digital Marketing<\/strong>\u201d article will rank high for a search query \u201c<em>how to hire a digital marketing company<\/em>\u201d just because your article contains the keyword, is a big mistake.<\/p>\n<p>You need to make sure your content serves specific user needs.<\/p>\n<p>Voice search has undoubtedly come a long way in a very small period. However, the technology is still evolving, and the algorithms powering it are only getting better. As such, we can expect newer and more effective content optimization strategies to be introduced in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Do you run a business that has online presence?<\/p>\n<p>Do you need help with optimizing your digital content for voice search?<\/p>\n<p>Search Berg is at your service!<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re one of the leading content marketing firms in the United States.
