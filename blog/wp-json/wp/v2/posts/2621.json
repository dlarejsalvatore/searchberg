Now why do we use CMS?<\/p>\n<p>Without Content Management Systems, those businesses that wanted to create websites would need to rely on experienced coders or learn the languages ourselves. Thankfully, we have Content Management Systems (CMS) at our disposal.<\/p>\n<p>So, a CMS like WordPress makes the process of not only designing, but also <em>managing websites<\/em> significantly easier and more streamlined.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc68181238\"><\/a>10 Best CMS Software for 2021<\/h2>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181239\"><\/a>1. WordPress: Cost &#8211; $0<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2634\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/blog2-1.png\" alt=\"wordpress\" width=\"1899\" height=\"804\" \/><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/wordpress-seo\/\">WordPress<\/a> is the most widely used CMS platform for websites. Using WordPress, you can create any kind of website, including a company website, personal portfolio, online store, etc.<\/p>\n<p>There are many benefits of WordPress. In terms of design freedom, WordPress has thousands of designs available for users to download and use, whether they&#8217;re directly from WordPress or third party WordPress theme websites like <a href=\"https:\/\/themeforest.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ThemeForest<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to being free, WordPress is also great for SEO. It allows you to easily create tags, update URLs and categories, and add separate plug-ins to improve your website&#8217;s SEO.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/blog-8.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress CMS features from their website's home page.\" width=\"730\" height=\"651\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2637\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The only downside is you&#8217;ll need to purchase your own domain through a domain hosting platform like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluehost.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">BlueHost<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181241\"><\/a>2. Drupal: Cost &#8211; $0<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2632\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/blog-8.jpg-9.png\" alt=\"Drupal\" width=\"1891\" height=\"672\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/drupal-seo\/\">Drupal<\/a> is super helpful if you have a huge amount of data you want to add on your website. It&#8217;s helpful for this purpose because it can handle extreme customization requirements and data.<\/p>\n<p>It has an in-built user system where you can manage what users can and cannot do. It has a vast array of themes available and you can increase Drupal&#8217;s functions using modules. It has previously installed automation tools for SEO as well.<\/p>\n<p>While you will need a hosting provider, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/hosting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> is a list of providers that support Drupal users.<\/p>\n<p>Drupal is also trusted by the following trusted brands.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2631\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/blog-8.jpg-8.png\" alt=\"Six trusted brands known to use Drupal for their websites, promoting it as one of the best CMS software.\" width=\"1063\" height=\"477\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You should know that because the interface is designed to handle complex tasks fit for developers, Drupal is less beginner-friendly relative to WordPress. In addition, its themes can also be pricey.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181243\"><\/a>3. Joomla: Cost &#8211; $0<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2630\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/blog-8.jpg-7.png\" alt=\"The Jooma CMS home page showing three options: to download, use, and learn Joomla.\" width=\"1259\" height=\"846\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As with WordPress and Drupal, you&#8217;re going to need to buy a domain separately. While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/joomla-seo\/\">Joomla<\/a> is also a veteran in the CMS game like WordPress, it&#8217;s equipped to handle large amounts of data and tasks that it can be daunting for beginners. In addition, it features a built-in user access system that allows you to regulate actions of registered users.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to go with Joomla and have little web development experience, you&#8217;d benefit from hiring a developer to handle building your website.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181244\"><\/a>4.

While there are some standard SEO functions, you&#8217;ll need to download a good extension for more abilities. One example of these extensions is the free Creare SEO 2.0 extension.<\/p>\n<p>While you can certainly access Magento for free using the software Magento OpenSource, you also have the option of paying Magento to manage it on their end. This can start from two grand USD per month.<\/p>\n<p>While Magento is a highly secure, powerful CMS, it&#8217;s not forgiving to beginners and will need you to have technical knowledge or someone on your team who does.<\/p>\n<p>If you own a B2B Ecommerce store and are looking to improve your conversions, check out our blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/11-ways-to-triple-your-b2b-ecommerce-conversions\/\">11 Ways To Triple Your B2B Ecommerce Conversions.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181246\"><\/a>5.

The CMS works for users whether you&#8217;re a beginner or a developer because you have the option to write code directly or use the drag-and-drop features.<\/p>\n<p>For that price point, it should be easy to use!<\/p>\n<p>As a bonus, you&#8217;ll also get SEO recommendations and easy A\/B testing capabilities in your website.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181248\"><\/a>6. BigCommerce: Cost &#8211; $30\/mo<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2627\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/blog-8.jpg-5.png\" alt=\"BigCommerce\" width=\"1894\" height=\"808\" \/><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/bigcommerce-seo\/\">BigCommerce<\/a> is also specifically for ecommerce stores, as implied by its name. The biggest selling point for BigCommerce is that it allows you to sell products through your own ecommerce website and big ecommerce marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay.<\/p>\n<p>You can either obtain a free domain name from BigCommerce which will have their brand name in the URL or you can purchase a custom domain.<\/p>\n<p>BigCommerce does lack a little in the design department, but you can integrate your BigCommerce site with WordPress to resolve that issue.<\/p>\n<p>The $30 covers a lot for starting companies and sole proprietors, but BigCommerce also has <strong><em>big<\/em><\/strong>-ger options with more features for larger organizations.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what CMS big companies use, if it&#8217;s an ecommerce company then it&#8217;s likely BigCommerce.<\/p>\n<p>If you make more than 50,000 USD in sales per year, then you&#8217;ll automatically be bumped up to the more pricey plan which is about $250 per month, so keep that in mind for your expenses.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181250\"><\/a>7.

It&#8217;s very straightforward and allows you to accept payments through multiple ways, including Shopify Payments and PayPal.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Shopify has apps you can install to your store that make it easy to increase your features. For example, if you&#8217;re dropshipping products, you can import reviews from your third-party supplier&#8217;s website using apps.<\/p>\n<p>While it has a more pricey option of around $300 per month that has more features, unlike BigCommerce, it doesn&#8217;t automatically upgrade your plan.<\/p>\n<p>Shopify&#8217;s main advantage is its simplicity because it handles hosting, security, and site maintenance. These crucial benefits of Shopify leave you free to go out and get customers.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181251\"><\/a>8. Squarespace: cost &#8211; starting at $16\/mo<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/squarespace-seo\/\">Squarespace<\/a> is great for less technical users who just want to create a basic website. So, personal websites, portfolio websites, and even company websites are easily made using Squarespace.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2625\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/blog-8.jpg-3.png\" alt=\"Squarespace's company message &quot;Simple tools for big ideas&quot; echoing the consensus that it is indeed a simple tool for beginners and non-complex website requirements.\" width=\"544\" height=\"383\" \/><\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re not the best for ecommerce stores because it&#8217;s so simple that your operation won&#8217;t be heavy-weight, per se.<\/p>\n<p>If you require more robust functionality in your website, though, Squarespace isn&#8217;t your best option.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181252\"><\/a>9.

With their subscription, you can pay monthly or annually, and their drag-and-drop features make constructing a website significantly stream-lined.<\/p>\n<p>You should remember, though, that with its simplicity and user-friendliness come some costs. For example, once you choose a designated template for your website, you can&#8217;t change it.<\/p>\n<p>The good thing is that each theme is adaptable to mobiles, tablets, and desktops, so there&#8217;s no bad template options here even if you get pigeon-holed into one template style.<\/p>\n<p>The ecommerce options for Wix will also be limited because it only accepts certain payment pathways like PayPal.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc68181254\"><\/a>10.
