The idea is to create authority, increase lead generation and overall SEO value.<\/p>\n<p>When you write blogs, you typically include key internal and external links that sort of connect your blog to other relevant pages and services that your readers might be interested in.<\/p>\n<p>That way, you\u2019re keeping them <em><i>engaged <\/i><\/em>longer to elicit a desired response\u2014a purchase of a product\/service, a call, etc. You\u2019re essentially trying to convert them from a <strong><u><b>reader<\/b><\/u><\/strong>\u00a0to a <strong><u><b>customer<\/b><\/u><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><b>Blogs are super important from a <\/b><\/strong><strong><em><b><i>conversation point of view<\/i><\/b><\/em><\/strong><strong><b>. <\/b><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong><a name=\"_Toc59543712\"><\/a>Articles<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Unlike blogs, articles can be posted anywhere <em><u><i>but<\/i><\/u><\/em>\u00a0on your own site.

Over the years, blogs and articles have become very similar when it comes to length. Let\u2019s call this a kind of convergence. Previously, articles were long and detailed (generally longer than 300 words) while blogs were short and to the point. Today, however, this demarcation has become increasingly blurred.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc59543714\"><\/a><strong><b>Blogs<\/b><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Blogs are divided into two main categories based on length: <strong><u><b>short-form blogs<\/b><\/u><\/strong>\u00a0and <strong><u><b>long-form blogs<\/b><\/u><\/strong>. In other words, you have full rein here; there are no rules.<\/p>\n<p>Short-form blogs typically range from 400\u2013800 words whereas long-form blogs are longer than 2000 words.<\/p>\n<p>Now, choosing the right length comes down to your target audience and brand identity. We strongly recommend working with a content marketing team to dive deeper into your audience\u2019s preferences. Are they interested in short, engaging, and witty blogs? Do they prefer long, insightful, and industry-rich blogs? Based on these insights, create a customized strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Track each blog\u2019s performance to gauge which blog length performs better than the others. Finalize your strategy and don\u2019t forget to update it on a monthly or bimonthly basis as you collect fresh insights.<\/p>\n<p><strong><b>Recommended Read: <\/b><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/how-to-write-a-blog-that-ranks\/\"><u>How to Write a Blog That Ranks<\/u><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>Articles<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Today, articles can be as short as 400 words or as long as 3000 words. Like blogs, there are no strict requirements you need to adhere to when it comes to length. Consult the website you\u2019re partnering with beforehand. In some cases, certain websites only accept articles of a specific length.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid facing rejection once your articles have been written and edited, get a strong grasp on the guidelines.

Go for a casual tone to engage and retain your audience in the long run. Of course, you can still incorporate facts and figures into your blogs, so long as you don\u2019t bore your audience.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Buzzfeed-article.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2390\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Buzzfeed-article.png\" alt=\"Buzzfeed article\" width=\"624\" height=\"321\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Strike the perfect balance between \u201cinforming\u201d and \u201cengaging\u201d your audience.

However, too much of anything can do more harm than good. Retain the balance we discussed earlier to ensure new visitors don\u2019t click off the article halfway through.<\/p>\n<p>As compared to blogs, articles also make use of facts and figures more frequently.

While blogs and articles have unique content styles, there\u2019s still lots of room for improvisation. If you want your articles to be more informal and laid back, feel free to do just that!<\/p>\n<p><strong><u><b>However, retain an air of professionalism amid the informality. <\/b><\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Remember, your articles will be a \u201cfirst impression\u201d of sorts for many people. With blogs, you\u2019re engaging an audience that\u2019s already familiar with your business. With articles, you\u2019re targeting <em><i>an entirely new audience<\/i><\/em>. In essence, your articles should exude an air of credibility. This is a great way to ensure new web users take you seriously.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc59543719\"><\/a><strong><b>What Is the SEO Strategy?\u00a0<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We also want to talk about the difference between blogs and articles in terms of SEO. No matter what content you\u2019re producing, you should have a razor-sharp focus on optimization. If you fail to double down on on-page SEO, your content will rank poorly on SERPs, resulting in not-so-great traffic generation and weak conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re writing blogs or articles, go all out on optimization. Use high-ranking keywords, Meta descriptions, title tags, headings, alt text, and URLs.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, incorporate high-quality internal and external links into your content. This will help you redirect readers to your own content and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/10-advanced-link-building-tips-and-tricks-to-boost-your-seo\/\"><u>generate more backlinks<\/u><\/a>. As you boost your link building potential, you\u2019ll also manage to increase your DA. Needless to say, sites with a high DA (Forbes, Entrepreneur, Medium, Inc., etc.) consistently appear among the top search results.<\/p>\n<p>The outcome? A massive inflow of traffic. As you follow suit, you\u2019ll increase your audience and grow your business in the long run.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc59543720\"><\/a><strong><b>Blogs<\/b><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>While both blogs and articles should be optimized similarly, use more internal links in your blogs. You can\u2019t always use this strategy when working on articles, especially if the third-party platform has a specific set of restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, you may not be able to use certain on-page SEO strategies for articles. If you face these restrictions, make sure you actively incorporate these sidelined optimization strategies into your own blogs.<\/p>\n<p>We also recommend using technical SEO strategies like increasing the speed of your blog page.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc59543721\"><\/a><strong><b>Articles<\/b><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When optimizing articles, use local keywords to target the right audience. While this is also a great strategy for blogs, it\u2019s all the more important for articles as you have little control over who engages with your content.<\/p>\n<p>Local keywords will help you target web users who are close to your business and can actually buy your products\/services. The more specific you can get with your SEO efforts, the better.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><b>What Is the Scope?<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>While you may feel compelled to cover multiple aspects of different topics in depth, that may not be possible, especially if you\u2019re working on a shorter blog\/article. Sidelining the scope can work to your detriment in this case.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><b>Blogs<\/b><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Focus is important. Don\u2019t digress. For instance, if you\u2019re writing a blog on the most popular wrought iron doors of the year, focus on a handful of properties like aesthetic appeal, functionality, maintenance, and durability. Sticking to the plan will help you cover important details as opposed to superficially touching upon a plethora of bases.<\/p>\n<p>In general, blogs are <em><u><i>more specific<\/i><\/u><\/em>\u2014even if you\u2019re opting for a long-form blog. You want to demonstrate industry insight.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><b>Articles<\/b><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As stated earlier, posting an article is akin to making a first impression on web users. You\u2019re targeting new people who know next to nothing about your business. As a rule of thumb, you want to give them <em><i>an overview<\/i><\/em>\u00a0of your industry insight.<\/p>\n<p>While you can use the same strategy for blogs, we recommend adopting a different approach this time around. Demonstrate variegated insight by giving your audience an overarching view of your industry insight and expertise.<\/p>\n<p>A great way to go about this is to quickly gloss over all your products\/services in the CTA. Remember, your blog readers already know about your products\/services; they frequently read your blogs. Web users who engage with your articles, however, don\u2019t know these particularities.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a criminal defense lawyer, include your practice areas in the CTAs for your articles. This will give new readers a quick overview of what your business is all about. In short, don\u2019t hesitate to cover more bases!<\/p>\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc59543725\"><\/a><strong><b>Wrapping Up!<\/b><\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>There\u2019s no denying that content marketing\u00a0is a great way to actively engage your target audience, boost conversions, retain customers, and dominate the digital realm.
