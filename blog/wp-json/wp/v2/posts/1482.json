For example, if someone has liked a page related to your niche, you can literally ride off the coattails of this page&#8217;s audience to target them for your business.<\/p>\n<p>For a Facebook ad to be successful, it needs to have three key components:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Specific and <strong>accurate targeting<\/strong>.

Collaborate With Similar Businesses to Increase Your Following<\/h2>\n<p>Struggling to boost your following? Collaborating with businesses in the same industry is a great way to double or triple your following.<\/p>\n<p>Ideal for small businesses, partnerships increase visibility within the same niche, thereby attracting potential customers with a strong intent to purchase.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you own a small salon, we recommend partnering with local businesses that sell hair products or skin rejuvenation tools. Approach them with a cross-promotional offer to increase following and sales for your business. Similarly, they\u2019ll also benefit from the collaboration, as your customers will visit their website and purchase their products\/services.<\/p>\n<p>While the clientele will be similar, the contrasting products\/services will ensure that one business\u2019s traffic isn\u2019t transferred to the other. Instead, the mutual benefits will help each business enjoy greater audience reach and sales.<\/p>\n<h2>8.

You can research it by looking through the hashtag on Facebook. You can also click on a hashtag that is generated on another site such as LinkedIn or Instagram. Chances are, there will be a continuation of that hashtag on Facebook as well.<\/p>\n<p>Once you find the trending topics in your niche\/industry, <strong>participate<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>Join the conversation, take a stance, and\/or provide deeper insight\/value into the topic.<\/p>\n<p>This will help you stand out.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Create a Private Group to Establish a Close Connection with Your Loyal Audience<\/h2>\n<p>While this powerful strategy seems counterintuitive to many, it\u2019s a great way to establish a strong connection with loyal customers. A private Facebook group increases personal engagement and helps frequent customers feel included in the brand\u2019s decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re working on a new product or are considering releasing an in-demand service, a <strong>quick heads up to your customers<\/strong> can go a long way in increasing audience retention.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend posting <strong>polls<\/strong>, <strong>updates<\/strong>, and <strong>behind-the-scenes images<\/strong> and <strong>videos<\/strong> to keep your audience engaged and entertained. In addition, ask for their <strong>feedback <\/strong>and announce <strong>special discounts<\/strong> to establish a connection that goes beyond a superficial buyer-seller relationship.<\/p>\n<p>CJ\u2019s Coffee Cafe\u2019s lighthearted, fun, and rewarding poll is a great example of engaging with group members and incorporating a little giveaway at the end:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1494\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"495\" height=\"437\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whether you follow a similar strategy or create a unique <strong>group atmosphere<\/strong> for your customers, <u>conscientiousness and dedication<\/u> will help create a <u>community<\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>As the group members feel appreciated and involved, they\u2019re also more likely to <strong>unknowingly market your products\/services<\/strong> to friends and family, thereby boosting reach and engagement.<\/p>\n<h2>10.
