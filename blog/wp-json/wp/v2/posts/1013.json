Take print media and digital media for example. Before people used to get their news from the local newspaper. Now they get it online, from their tablet. Nothing against print media which is still there in some form. But with this shift, we basically witnessed an example of content evolving to serve the vast interest of the public.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we are seeing another similar paradigm shift where digital media is being replaced by Video media.<\/p>\n<p>Video content has been here for some time, and it has been gradually shaping up into a VERY strong trend. It\u2019s turning into a super content marketing craze.<\/p>\n<p>And for some very impressive reasons.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>No Medium Attracts Traffic Faster and Larger than Video<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The results are in. Study after study has shown people response more to Video which is why Video content has big admirers across the globe.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point\u2014YouTube\u2014 the giant boasts a viewership of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/social-media-marketing\/social-media-strategy\/new-global-social-media-research\/\">1.5 billion monthly active users<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Our current worldwide population is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/world-population\/\">nearly 7.6 billion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That means, one out of every five people in the world has a YouTube account and since you don\u2019t actually need an account to view YouTube, imagine how many people actually use it in their daily lives \u2014 now that would be a massive number!<\/p>\n<p>And of course, with huge audience, comes huge traffic.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aberdeen.com\/about\/\">Aberdeen Group<\/a>, a leading market intelligence firm, companies using videos on their websites generate 41% more web traffic from search engines than those that don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway:<\/strong> If you want more traffic on your website, start creating videos of your products or services.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Videos Leads To Sales!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Okay, traffic without conversions isn\u2019t really impressive.<\/p>\n<p>But who says videos don\u2019t convert?<\/p>\n<p>Latest data <a href=\"http:\/\/awesome.vidyard.com\/rs\/273-EQL-130\/images\/Vidyard_Aberdeen_Impact_of_Video_Marketing.pdf\">reveals<\/a>, video users enjoy 27% higher click-through rates and 34% higher web conversion rates, compared to non-users.<\/p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/blog\/video-landing-page-examples\">study<\/a> reveals adding video to a landing page boosts conversions by as much as 80%.<\/p>\n<p>One case study that makes for a strong case is that of Dropbox.<\/p>\n<p>When Dropbox was first launched, the concept was foreign to most.<\/p>\n<p>Users could not understand what it was about and how it operated.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, the company struggled with conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Later, they decided to add an introductory video to their landing page.<\/p>\n<p>And guess what?<\/p>\n<p>Their conversions instantly increased!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway: <\/strong>If you want more conversions on your website, start investing in videos<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Videos Sell Products and Services<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Arguably the strongest point of videos is that they sell a product or service effectively.<\/p>\n<p>It has been found that companies that use video boost revenue <a href=\"http:\/\/awesome.vidyard.com\/rs\/273-EQL-130\/images\/Vidyard_Aberdeen_Impact_of_Video_Marketing.pdf\">49% faster year-over-year<\/a> than companies that don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>This can be attributed to four factors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Videos communicate marketing messages and product concepts in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forrester.com\/report\/How+Video+Will+Take+Over+The+World\/-\/E-RES44199?isTurnHighlighting=false&amp;highlightTerm=1.8%2520million%2520words\">clear manner<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Consumers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/consumer-insights\/youtube-stars-influence\/\">trust<\/a> video content more in comparison to other content pieces<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brainrules.net\/vision\">easy to retain information<\/a> about a product when communicated through video, thereby increasing the likelihood of conversions.<\/li>\n<li>Consumers consume video content <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@CarolForden\/how-video-can-raise-customer-engagement-and-revenue-744493902a6f\">more thoroughly<\/a> than blogs, articles, whitepapers and e-books.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>The takeaway:<\/strong> If you want to increase business revenue, start investing in videos.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>This is THE TIME to take advantage of the opportunity<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Businesses around the world have already started creating marketing strategies around video content.
