Are you getting any mileage out of it in terms of generating traffic for your business or gaining new viewers and readership? Do you want it to perform better? If so, then keep on reading.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps of optimizing your WordPress blog for SEO purposes that would ultimately rank your blog post quickly in search engines and also rank high in order to generate increased traffic.<\/p>\n<p>We will focus on the blog post itself, and then viewers can expand upon that from there to optimize all of their WordPress blog posts, one by one, until the entire WordPress blog is fully optimized for SEO.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Tools of the Trade<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We recommend using only one tool. This one enjoys universal acclaim and we have had tremendous success with it when it comes to our clients.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/\">Yoast SEO<\/a> plugin.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s simple to use (even non-coders can use it easily), and it comes packed with great features.<\/p>\n<p>Some popular features include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick image scans<\/li>\n<li>Meta detail analysis<\/li>\n<li>Follow and no follow links quantification<\/li>\n<li>Basic SEO analysis report<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The list just goes on\u2026<\/p>\n<p>The very first thing you need to do (of course, aside from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/content-marketing.html\">creating a stunning blog<\/a>) is to download the Yoast SEO plugin for your WordPress website.<\/p>\n<p>You can do that by accessing the \u201cPlugins\u201d section from your WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>Once the download is complete, you should be able to see a section titled \u201cYoast SEO\u201d on the \u201cEdit Post\u201d page of your WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"468\" height=\"276\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s move on to the next step and the <em>actual<\/em> optimization process.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Optimizing the Metadata<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Meta details refer to the meta title and meta description of your blog post. Google uses this information to determine relevancy, and rankability based on an entered search term. To elaborate.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Meta title is the title of your web page (blog post) that appears on the SERPs.<\/li>\n<li>Meta descriptions are the descriptions that appear right below your Meta title and tell users what your webpage (blog post) is all about.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"431\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the above image, the text in the black box is the meta title and the text in red box is the meta description.<\/p>\n<p>If optimized correctly, both meta title and meta description can increase traffic to your webpage (blog post). This includes.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping the Meta Title between 45 and 60 characters (including whitespaces). It should contain your primary keyword, preferably at the beginning.<\/li>\n<li>Keeping the Meta Description length to no more than 160 characters. Its phrasing should entice readers to click on your blog post. Adding a keyword to meta descriptions doesn\u2019t help your blog\u2019s ranking on search engines, but it can boost the click-through rate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now that you know the main guidelines, the next questions is how to apply it towards a blog post. This is where Yoast comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Visit your Yoast SEO section and click on \u201cEdit Snippet\u201d button.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"471\" height=\"283\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This will expand the window, revealing the SEO title and meta description boxes:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"457\" height=\"271\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Type the SEO title (meta title) and meta description of your choice.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Optimize the URL<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>All web pages, including your blog post has a unique URL.<\/p>\n<p>By default, WordPress adds the title of your blog post to the URL when you publish the post. This default setting isn\u2019t bad at all; in fact, it\u2019s really good for search engine optimization.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you want to customize your blog post URL to make it look even better, you can do so by typing your desired URL in the \u201cSlug\u201d box of the snippet editor.<\/p>\n<p>Remember the snippet editor?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1019\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"474\" height=\"362\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are couple of tips for optimizing your blog post URL for increased traffic:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include a keyword in the URL<\/li>\n<li>Keep the URL short<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Rand Fishkin, co-founder of MOZ, has some more suggestions on URL structuring. You can read about them by clicking <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/15-seo-best-practices-for-structuring-urls\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Optimize the &lt;h1&gt; tag<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The &lt;h1&gt; tag is the main title of your blog post as it appears on the webpage.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the &lt;h1&gt; tag for this blog post is \u201cHow to optimize Your WordPress Blog Post for Increased Traffic\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>&lt;h1&gt; tags are very important on-page elements. They tell search engines what your blog post is about.<\/p>\n<p>Many website owners prefer using the same title for their &lt;h1 tags&gt; and meta titles. However, if you want, you can keep the two different. Just make sure your &lt;h1&gt; tag isn\u2019t noticeably different to your meta title; you don\u2019t want the search user to get confused by two different versions of your blog post title that say two different things.<\/p>\n<p>To optimize the &lt;h1&gt; tag of your blog post, click on the \u201cPosts\u201d section and manually type the header tag in the \u201cAdd New Post\u201d box.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"483\" height=\"346\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t Forget About Image Optimization<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When we talk about optimizing images on a WordPress blog post, we mean optimizing the ALT text attribute of those images for better search engine indexing.<\/p>\n<p>Alt text describes the appearance and function of an image on a web page. It\u2019s embedded in the HTML code of your WordPress website.<\/p>\n<p>By default, the alt text of an image can contain different alphabets and numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Focus on making them descriptive (and relevant) in the context of the subject matter of the image, you can improve on both the above aspects.<\/p>\n<p>To optimize the alt text of the images used on your WordPress blog post, click on the \u201cPosts\u201d section on your WordPress dashboard and click on the image you want to add the alt text to. Hit the \u201cEdit\u201d icon and type the alt text of your choice.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll suggest adding a keyword to the alt text for better optimization results.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Optimize the Social Media Metadata<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin also allows you to share your blog post on social media sites.<\/p>\n<p>The meta data for social media sharing is pulled by the plug in itself (unless specified) from the blog post content and used for creating posts for Facebook, Twitter etc.<\/p>\n<p>You can override this meta data and make your social media posts more creative and clickable by clicking on the \u201cShare\u201d icon within the \u201cYoast SEO\u201d section and specifying the content as per your wish.<\/p>\n<p>There are some other optimization techniques as well that you can implement, for instance, including internal and external links to your WordPress blog post and designing a clickable CTA.<\/p>\n<p>Rest assured, following these steps will set your WordPress blog post on the right path and over time start delivering long term results and viewership.
