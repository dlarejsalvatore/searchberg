Over time, the number of backlinks remains consistent but fails to increase.<\/p>\n<p>In comparison, one of your key competitors earns <em>a lot of backlinks<\/em>\u00a0from companies with an average DA of 75.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, you\u2019re both garnering a similar amount of traffic and ranking identically on Google SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u2019ve prioritized quality, you\u2019ve sidelined quantity. And while your competitor has doubled down on quantity, they\u2019ve let go of quality.<\/p>\n<p>If you give one aspect more importance over the other, you\u2019ll struggle to unlock your link building potential and improve your online presence.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some key aspects of backlink quantity that should be kept in mind when creating a link building strategy:<\/p>\n<h3><strong><b>1. Referring Domains<\/b><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A referring domain is a site that \u201crefers\u201d to your business without providing a hyperlink, i.e., they mention your company without including clickable anchor text.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re hyperfocused on backlink quality, you\u2019ll disregard the importance of referring domains.<\/p>\n<p>After all, how can you possibly benefit from mere mentions that don\u2019t redirect web users to your site?<\/p>\n<p>Well, <em>you can,<\/em>\u00a0and more than you may think.<\/p>\n<p>According to research, the number of referring domains determines how well you rank on Google SERPs.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2549\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/a-graph-illustrating-the-correlation-between-the-number-of-referring-domains-and-Google-position.png\" alt=\"a graph illustrating the correlation between the number of referring domains and Google position\" width=\"624\" height=\"420\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Of course, converting unlinked mentions into strong backlinks is a great way to <em>rank even higher <\/em>on SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>But dismissing the quantity of referring domains altogether will cost you in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>While they may not be clickable, unlinked mentions cause visible ripples.<\/p>\n<p>Web users may have to do a little extra work by manually looking up your business, but they <em><u>will<\/u><\/em>\u00a0take the initiative if the mention is compelling enough!<\/p>\n<p>By focusing on the quantity of backlinks, you\u2019ll manage to increase your referring domains and gradually work towards converting them into backlinks.<\/p>\n<h3><strong><b>2.
