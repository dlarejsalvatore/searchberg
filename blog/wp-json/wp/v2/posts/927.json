If you don\u2019t have the right tools, insights, and resources, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/instagram-marketing\/\">using Instagram for business<\/a> can seem like an uphill battle.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to Instagram marketing, joining the platform is a great step in itself. The social media site ranks 3<sup>rd<\/sup> on the most-used (per daily basis) social media platforms, according to the statistics reported in\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewinternet.org\/2018\/03\/01\/social-media-use-in-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201dnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">Pew Research Center\u2019s 2018 Social Media Use Survey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc46483164\"><\/a>Marketing Tips to Help Grow Your Brand on Instagram<\/h2>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc46483165\"><\/a>Prioritize Aesthetics<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1827 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blog-2.jpg\" alt=\"engaging and attractive Instagram design templates\" width=\"626\" height=\"417\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The people featured on Instagram accounts are attractive, the sceneries pretty, and the packaging pristine. Plus, there\u2019s consistency; the pictures on many popular IG accounts follow a similar theme, so that when displayed in a grid format on the profile, the photos look cohesive.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a photographer or not, you will find yourself appreciating the nature of these pictures, their beautiful subjects, their use of focal points and negative space,\u00a0and the inclusion of complementary, often pastel hues. Makeup brands are particularly competent in establishing a perfect flow of colors in pictures on IG.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you do what they do? Yes, they have professional photographers and graphic designers, but you don\u2019t need to master either to have an attractive Instagram profile.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1817\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blog.jpg\" alt=\"insta\" width=\"1200\" height=\"250\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll find a ton of photo editing tools and filters, perfect for non-designers who find working with light and colors challenging. In fact, nearly\u00a0<strong>60% of top brands\u2019 Instagram accounts<\/strong>\u00a0use a consistent filter\u00a0for all content.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, as most beauty brands do, you can also reuse a picture in a different shade if you are selling one product in multiple colors. Recolor and repeat\u2014it works well for those with scarce content.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc46483166\"><\/a>Leverage the Digitization of Interactions<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1818 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blog1.jpg\" alt=\"phone screen displaying a user\u2019s Instagram feed\" width=\"755\" height=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To understand Instagram users, we need to understand human behavior today.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re social creatures and crave interaction; the growth of social media\u2014with its many features for sharing information in a creative manner\u2014allows humans to take their usual conversations online.<\/p>\n<p>This includes asking for advice to finalize purchase decisions. So if a person loves a particular product and talks about it on IG, you can bet that their friends and family will be curious and develop interest in it.<\/p>\n<p>In short, to sell in 2020, you need to implement a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/what-social-media-strategies-can-boost-my-seo\/\">strong social media strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram has witnessed substantial user growth in the past few years,\u00a0from 28% of U.S. adults using IG in 2016 to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/internet\/fact-sheet\/social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201dnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">37%\u00a0of U.S. adults<\/a>\u00a0using Instagram today. The underlying contributor? Brands with visually engaging and informative Instagram pages.<\/p>\n<p>To use IG the\u00a0<em>right<\/em>\u00a0way, follow their lead. Here are a few reasons why these brands\u2019 IG accounts look amazing and receive a great response.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc46483167\"><\/a>Use Relevant Hashtags to Sell on Instagram<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1819 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blog2.jpg\" alt=\"template of an Instagram post illustrating the importance of using hashtags to sell on Instagram\" width=\"626\" height=\"626\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Beauty brands are not popular for their powerful aesthetic alone. They\u2019re also popular for their words. In particular, their use of hashtags and phototags. IG is visual, so graphics are everything\u2014if they reach the right people.<\/p>\n<p>Like Twitter and Facebook hashtags, Instagram hashtags are an organic way of boosting content visibility. Instagram posts that include at least one hashtag receive\u00a0<strong>over 12% more engagement<\/strong>\u00a0than posts that exclude hashtags entirely.<\/p>\n<p>And just like Twitter, the right hashtags matter on Instagram, which allows up to 30 hashtags per post. But this can look too spammy and overdone. However, if you\u2019re using Instagram like a beauty brand does, you\u2019ll use hashtags the way they do: separate from the main caption, with periods-for-line-breaks. You can also add your hashtags to the first comment, posted separately.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/heatherleighton\/2019\/08\/31\/where-instagram-hashtags-should-go-caption-first-comment\/#6e88cacd384c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201dnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">Hunting the right hashtags<\/a> requires thought and some additional help. You can use online analytics tools to find hashtags on IG. You can also search for hashtags directly on IG\u2019s \u201cDiscover\u201d section, where you can view the number of times a particular hashtag has been used.<\/p>\n<p>Or you can hand over this task over to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/social-media-marketing.html\">social media marketing experts<\/a> who are adept at sifting through and finding the best keywords for your brand. Not only will they help make your content more visible, but they\u2019ll also ensure you\u2019re able to effectively sell on Instagram.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc46483168\"><\/a>Incorporate Photo Tags<\/h3>\n<p>Beauty brands make use of photo tagging on their posts. Photo tagging on IG is similar to tagging people in your photos on Facebook; only you can tag anyone outside your followers list (provided they allow tagging). Beauty brands tag celebrities\u2014whose fans can then discover that post.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to tagging other people, you can\u00a0also\u00a0tag your products (which you have been allowed to sell through IG) in your photos. Users can access the product pages directly though these. It\u2019s that simple.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc46483169\"><\/a>Conversations With Followers Matter<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1820 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/blog1-1.jpg\" alt=\"concept illustration of a brand representative and customer communicating via Instagram direct messages\" width=\"626\" height=\"626\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a commercial contractor or a turnkey white label gaming software provider, you have much to gain from engaging and responding to customers on any social media account, including Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some ways to enhance engagement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask followers questions about their favorite products, content preferences, and recommendations<\/li>\n<li>Host product giveaways or offer free services provided that your followers tag their friends in the comments and request them to follow your account<\/li>\n<li>Collaborate with an influencer to expand your audience (more on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/influencer-marketing\/\">influencer marketing<\/a> here)<\/li>\n<li>Answer queries in the comments and reply to any compliments\/concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc46483170\"><\/a>Share Insightful Stories to Humanize Your Brand<\/h3>\n<p>Give your followers unique insight into the product creation\/service delivery process with the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/help.instagram.com\/1660923094227526\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201dnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">Stories feature<\/a>.
