If you can\u2019t answer in a heartbeat, we have a problem.<\/p>\n<p>What we\u2019re trying to say is, you need to have social media goals for your small business. And every interaction and success you have needs to be measured against these goals.<\/p>\n<p>Walk yourself through the buyer\u2019s journey for your product or service, and at each step, identify what your target is, what kind of social activity you\u2019ll use to achieve that target, what the KPIs are for that activity, and the impact you want it to have. This sets up a nifty feedback loop that allows you to tweak your content to your heart\u2019s content.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few examples of social media goals to get you started:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase web traffic<\/li>\n<li>Increase how many people engage with your posts<\/li>\n<li>Make people aware of your brand<\/li>\n<li>Distribute informative content regarding a product\/service<\/li>\n<li>Get more sign ups<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc70174091\"><\/a><b>2.\u00a0<\/b><strong><b>Define and Own Your Brand\u2019s Voice<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3166\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Nordstrom-campaign-facebook.png\" alt=\"Nordstrom\u2019s campaign to do better with sustainable fashion\" width=\"374\" height=\"616\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dwell on this campaign from social media titan and clothing behemoth Nordstrom for a bit.

They want a magical Oz-like character behind the curtains, orchestrating the company; someone who\u2019s a real big personality. They also want this person to be the face of the company, so they\u2019re talking to someone they can trust.<\/p>\n<p>So, what does this mean for your small business\u2019s social media marketing\u00a0plan? For starters, if you\u2019re the owner and fashion yourself to have even a little bit of charisma, try to put yourself front and center in all the video content you put out. Better yet, get the whole team on board by asking employees if being the public face of the company is something they\u2019re interested in.<\/p>\n<p>You could also go the behind-the-scenes route with your social media presence\u2014this really humanizes your company.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc70174092\"><\/a><b>3.\u00a0<\/b><strong><b>Who\u2019s Your Social Audience?<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3167\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/social-marketing-right-person.png\" alt=\"graphic of the right person being targeted with a social media strategy\" width=\"1174\" height=\"726\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s marketing 101, but we\u2019ll scream it from the rooftops anyway: <strong><b>you need to know your audience<\/b><\/strong>!

Your social media digital marketing strategy\u00a0needs to account for all possible variables.<\/p>\n<p>The answer, as always, lies in data.

All it did was take customers using their product in daring situations, and it put a new spin on an old format.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not cheating if you make the content your own! Here\u2019s the thing, there\u2019s no such thing as completely novel content\u2014it\u2019s always a mishmash of what\u2019s been done before, made new with your unique twist on it.<\/p>\n<p>So when we say that the map to your success already exists, we mean it. All you need to do is look at what established competitors have been doing for a really long time\u2014what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what you can take and improve upon.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, industries need to keep up with trends, and you want to be ahead of the curve too, not always catching up. That means you need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take competitors\u2019 content and find a way to make it fresh<\/li>\n<li>Alongside, you need to innovate, so customers see you as the popular new kid around the block<\/li>\n<li>You can also mix and match competitors\u2019 content to create new formats altogether<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc70174094\"><\/a><b>5.\u00a0<\/b><strong><b>Serve Up Some Value Additive Content<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Nothing gets your followers to leave en masse like you wasting their time.

That every post you make needs to be worth your audience\u2019s time. We\u2019re not saying you need to be somber and informative either\u2014casual tones work great, but the post still needs to tell potential customers something they want to hear.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a social media post from social media staple Starbucks:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3169\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/starbucks-post.png\" alt=\"Starbucks\u2019 social media marketing strategy\u00a0that involved product features\" width=\"397\" height=\"497\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notice how the post is beyond chill (pun intended), but it tells you a lot about the product.

Notice how at the same time, they have new social media posts, Highlights, and Stories for consumers to peruse. It\u2019s an all-of-the-above approach that really seems to show that the brand is doing well.<\/p>\n<p>Do you only post GIFs on your Buzzfeed-esque pop culture page? How about changing it up by posting compilation videos as well? Have an Instagram feed that your customers already love? Spice up engagement levels by leveraging Stories, IGTV, and Highlights. You get the picture.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the kicker, even conventional wisdom flies out the door if you\u2019re only posting the same type of content.

But data untapped serves no purposes, which is why platforms like Facebook and Instagram give you unprecedented insight into who your followers are, how much engagement they exhibit, and how they find your content.<\/p>\n<p>But metrics can be deceptive; for instance, being bent on the number of likes and followers means nothing if your page isn\u2019t getting the kind of targeted engagement that leads to someone taking a desired business action.<\/p>\n<p>Wait, what does any of that mean? To simplify, if you\u2019re running an up and coming residential repairs business and get a ton of likes on your blog posts, but not one of those leads actually calls you to step in, it\u2019s a major problem.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s super important to identify what metrics are important to you, and then proceed to double down on them.<\/p>\n<p>So, buckle up, because we\u2019re taking a deep dive.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc70174098\"><\/a>a.\u00a0Impressions<\/h3>\n<p>Impressions is just a metric that tells you how many times a post showed up on people\u2019s social timelines.

This is because engagement tells you how many people actually <em><i>interacted <\/i><\/em>with your post. This includes likes, shares, and comments, among a host of other actions, based on the platform.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc70174100\"><\/a>c.\u00a0Visits<\/h3>\n<p>Visits tells you how many people went from a post to your main profile.

Hire a team to reply to customers with questions and complaints, and make sure you steer clear of stock answers as you talk to them.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc70174117\"><\/a><b>11.\u00a0<\/b><strong><b>Look For Trends\u00a0<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Old Spice ALS Ice Bucket Challenge\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WfO8LR_VosI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>From the #ALSIceBucketChallenge to dabbing, and even the dark places the internet went to with the Tide pod challenge, online pop culture never stays put.<\/p>\n<p>The key here is to take these trends and adopt them in a way that makes sense for your brand.

They can help you develop a long-term strategy that takes an omnichannel approach, while also optimizing for each platform keeping best practices in mind.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win-win scenario, because freeing up resources that would be otherwise spent on social media management will open you up to generating revenues using core business activities.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blog-cta style3\">\n<h3>Social media marketing business plans that work!
