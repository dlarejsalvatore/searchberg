Rather, Google Fred\u2019s function serves as a guideline for those who want their business to be known for quality content, rather than just ad revenue.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Google Fred<\/h2>\n<p>Google Fred targets sites that overuse ads, produce low-quality content and have little added user benefits. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that all the sites Fred targets are just dummy sites created for ad revenue.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, majority of the websites <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/googles-fred-update-hit-low-value-content-sites-aimed-revenue-helping-users-271165\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affected<\/a> by Fred are content sites that just use a large number of ads, and are simply created to generate revenue, rather than produce any quality solution for the user\u2019s issues.<\/p>\n<p>The numerous websites that are affected by Google Fred update include sites that have the following elements;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A large presence of ads, making users experience difficulty to reach their desired information<\/li>\n<li>Content that is created solely for the purpose of increase ranking<\/li>\n<li>Content that has ads and affiliate links spread throughout<\/li>\n<li>Information (in blog form) which is far below the industry\u2019s specific components<\/li>\n<li>Deceptive advertisement<\/li>\n<li>Thin content<\/li>\n<li>Aggressive affiliate setup<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How Do You Know If You\u2019ve Been Affected By Google Fred Update?<\/h3>\n<p>The simplest way is by observing your ranking. A large drop in rankings or low organic traffic after mid-March is a strong indicator that your website has been impacted by Google Fred.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Fred Recovery Tips<\/h2>\n<p>Google Fred Update focuses on limiting the effects of black-hat SEO tactics. The best and simplest fix is to scale down ad inclusion and improve the quality of content on your website as the very first step of Google Fred recovery.<\/p>\n<p>But this is easier said than done.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/our-strategy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEO tactics<\/a> have improved considerably over the past few years, guided by Google\u2019s algorithm updates. However, to improve further, follow certain tactics and strategies to ensure you satisfy Google Fred\u2019s requirements.<\/p>\n<h3>Upgrading the Anatomy of On-Page SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Meta tags and keyword density are important while quality content and key factors to create credible content are even more crucial.<\/p>\n<h3>Practices for Improved SEO Rankings<\/h3>\n<p>Before we dive into the anatomy of a well-optimized page in Google Fred Recovery process, approach SEO tactics keeping these three questions in mind:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1 \u2013 What does the User Want?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although the main cause for Google\u2019s update is not yet clear, the basic concept behind Google Fred update can be regarded as a method to prompt websites to create user-centric content to improve company-client interaction.<\/p>\n<p>As such, our first goal should be to focus on serving users, not just Google. That is how we will get the rankings we need.<\/p>\n<p>Google itself is a growing network based on intelligence. To get its attention, securing the visitor\u2019s attention should be our first priority.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2 \u2013 Is the Website Optimized for Mobile Accessibility? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/images.pexels.com\/photos\/265087\/pexels-photo-265087.jpeg?h=650&amp;auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb\" alt=\"\" width=\"575\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Though optimizing your website isn\u2019t as much of an adventurous undertaking as it was five or six years ago, there are still millions of websites that have not upgraded their network. Keep in mind that Google penalizes websites that are not mobile friendly.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/searchberg.com\">SEO services<\/a> emphasize the importance of making such websites accessible for mobiles and this helps in increasing traffic and improving organic rankings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3 \u2013 Is Active Publishing Necessary?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google Fred focuses on consistent publishing to maintain a website\u2019s health. If companies want to maintain their position in the search engine\u2019s ranking, websites must create high-quality content and publish frequently. This shows the website as a relevant and active database, one that uses valid strategies to make its way through the algorithm\u2019s changes.<\/p>\n<h2>Small On-Page SEO Factors for Search Engines<\/h2>\n<p>In order to improve website ranking in the process of Google Fred recovery, there are several factors we must implement in the content.<\/p>\n<h3>Beginning Title Tag with Keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Typically, the title tag should contain a keyword close to the beginning of the title to give it more weight. The title tag is the most important factor for on-page SEO, since search engines seek titles that are <i>relevantly marked<\/i>.<\/p>\n<h3>SEO-Friendly URLs<\/h3>\n<p>Google favors short and keyword-rich URLs, rather than irregular URLs. For example, if a URL is <strong>searchberg.com\/your-keyword<\/strong>, Google will more likely boost this site\u2019s ranking, rather than <strong>searchberg.com\/7-22-2017\/category\/blogtitle<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>Adding Modifiers in Title<\/h3>\n<p>Modifiers specify long-tail versions of certain keywords. Using modifiers such as 2017, guide, review or best allows Google to improve rankings by separating your website\u2019s information from the general content.<\/p>\n<h3>Include Multimedia<\/h3>\n<p>Your first impression must encourage interaction, rather than just a skim through the content. Add engaging images, videos and diagrams with relevant information that increases the reader\u2019s awareness, and reduces bounce time.<\/p>\n<h3>Add Keywords within the first 100 Words<\/h3>\n<p>It takes 8 seconds for a reader to skim through content. Add relevant keywords within the 100 words of the published content to provide the visitor with the information they need. Then <a href=\"http:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/4-point-checklist-for-impactful-seo-articles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improve on the content<\/a> by providing added info to increase their time on-site.<\/p>\n<h3>Use Outbound Links<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Outbound links<\/a> allow your page to create a relevancy signal, which in turn, helps Google figure out what your page\u2019s subject is. But be advised that websites linked to outbound links must be pertinent to the subject and legitimately helpful. News websites or informative links are more favorable, rather than separate articles or blogs.<\/p>\n<h3>Add Internal Links<\/h3>\n<p>Google emphasizes a proper linking structure for websites that want to be indexed by search engines. Add 2\u20133 links to the content you post and make it relatable to the present content details.<\/p>\n<h3>Boost Site Speed<\/h3>\n<p>75% of users do not revisit a website if it takes more than 4 seconds to load. Use a CDN to boost your site speed. Compress images or switch to a faster hosting to allow easier access to your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Image Link Optimization<\/h3>\n<p>The target keyword of your image is part of the content itself. Make sure to add image file names that also include your target keywords to create relevance and coherency in the content.<\/p>\n<h3>Include Social Sharing Buttons<\/h3>\n<p>Even if there is no direct linking, social sharing does play a significant role in ranking your site. Social share bring in more visitors. And the more customers there are, the more likely they will be to link back to the site in question.<\/p>\n<h3>Post Longer Content<\/h3>\n<p>Longer content tends to rank higher on Google\u2019s first page, because that translates into a greater attention to content and the details added to make it relevant.<\/p>\n<h2>Increasing Dwell Time through Strategic SEO Practices<\/h2>\n<p>SEO practices require effort on the business\u2019s part to bring in more customers. Observing all the factors mentioned above among others, Google uses the techniques to determine a visitor\u2019s dwell time so as to size up the content\u2019s quality above all. If someone hits the back button immediately after landing on the page, this translates the link as a low-quality page to Google.<\/p>\n<p>Increase the page\u2019s average dwell time by including long and engaging content that provides authentic and helpful information to keep readers engaged and interested.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s search algorithm may not have the same earth-shattering effects now as it did 10 years ago. But that doesn\u2019t mean that its updates do not have a significant impact on your site\u2019s traffic and ranking.<\/p>\n<p>Our customer base is growing diverse day-by-day.
