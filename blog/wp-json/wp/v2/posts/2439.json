Each company page features a section entitled \u201ccompany photos.\u201d Some businesses make the mistake of uploading little to no images in this section. So when a LinkedIn user clicks on your profile and browses through the \u201ccompany information\u201d section, all they\u2019ll see is a bunch of text.

Incorporate different types of content into the mix\u2014blogs, articles, guest posts, press releases, infographics, and instructographics.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a set of value-added and optimized content ready to go, write an equally compelling LinkedIn post to supplement your content.<\/p>\n<p>Patricia Hartmann, a writer in Ojai, California, creates the perfect segue into one of her blogs:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-16.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2456\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-16.png\" alt=\"Sharing Value-Added, Insightful, Compelling Content on LinkedIn to gain followers\" width=\"545\" height=\"578\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Keeping the current context in mind, she focuses on inspiring her audience by helping them break away from the ongoing uncertainty, chaos, and stress triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Read: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/8-ways-to-adjust-your-seo-strategy-amid-the-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic\/\">8 Ways to Adjust Your SEO Strategy Amid the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Starbucks used a similar approach on New Year\u2019s Eve:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-17.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2457\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-17.png\" alt=\"Sharing Value-Added, Insightful, Compelling Content on LinkedIn to gain followers\" width=\"541\" height=\"497\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, your content should <em><u>make an impact<\/u><\/em>. Avoid cookie-cutter content strategy. The more creative you can get, the better. And, of course, keep optimization in mind at all times.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc61021486\"><\/a>6. Make the Most of Polls<\/h3>\n<p>Over the past few years, polls have taken LinkedIn by storm, and it\u2019s easy to see why. They\u2019re quick. They\u2019re engaging. They\u2019re exciting. The best part? You can leverage polls for <em><u>a wide range of purposes<\/u><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re trying to get feedback on a newly-launched product or curious about where your audience stands with respect to something like remote working, creating a quick poll is a great way to double down on engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix\u2019s smart poll earned a whopping 13,633 votes because of the compelling question and equally impressive options.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-18.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2458\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-18.png\" alt=\"Using polls to increase followers on LinkedIn\" width=\"541\" height=\"399\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s be real; if we could, we\u2019d immediately hit one of those four options depending on our Netflix viewing history.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s something about polls that <em>compels people to participate<\/em>, which is exactly why they\u2019re so popular on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>We strongly recommend posting <strong><u>1\u20132 polls every other week<\/u><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>However, make sure you\u2019re not posting polls <em>just for the sake of it<\/em>. If you don\u2019t have a great idea in mind, it\u2019s better to skip your weekly poll than to post one that\u2019s too dull to engage people.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another great example to help you get inspired:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-19.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2459\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-19.png\" alt=\"Using polls to increase followers on LinkedIn\" width=\"537\" height=\"444\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>What makes this specific poll even better is the unique way it brilliantly prompts further engagement in the comments. This is how you check off <em><u>all the boxes<\/u><\/em>! Not only did this post receive a plethora of votes, but it also earned a decent amount of comments.<\/p>\n<p>Follow suit and you\u2019ll be taken aback by how rapidly you manage to increase your LinkedIn followers.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc61021487\"><\/a>7. Highlight Your Company\u2019s Accomplishments<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you run a small business or recently launched a startup, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ve accomplished certain milestones along the way\u2014both big and small. Many businesses manage to check off 1\u20132 accomplishments within the first few month of inception!<\/p>\n<p>If you have something to show off, <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2020\/06\/02\/14-tips-for-showing-off-awards-and-accolades-without-bragging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">show it off<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Be proud of your company\u2019s performance and growth, and don\u2019t shy away from announcing it on LinkedIn. You\u2019ll manage to present your business in a flattering light, and engage more people.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla frequently posts its accomplishments, and this strategy always works in their favor.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-20.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2460\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-20.png\" alt=\"tesla\" width=\"541\" height=\"291\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>18,385 reactions and 402 comments. Now, <em>that\u2019s<\/em> engagement. Showcase your company\u2019s achievements accordingly and you\u2019ll manage to climb the rungs of LinkedIn. You don\u2019t have to highlight awards. You can also announce the number of projects you closed, especially if your company exceeded its goals. If a certain product did exceptionally well, highlight that. If you earned a noteworthy mention by an industry giant, highlight that. If your customer satisfaction (CSAT) score improved by leaps and bounds, highlight that.<\/p>\n<p>In essence, drawing attention to your company\u2019s successes will help you build a great reputation and get more followers on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc61021488\"><\/a>8. Create Special Posts for Major Events, Holidays, and Trends<\/h3>\n<p>Struggling to increase engagement on your LinkedIn company page? Take a quick look at your recent posts. Did you create a custom post for New Year\u2019s? Christmas? Black Friday? Cyber Monday? If you didn\u2019t, make sure you double down on major events, holidays, and trends in 2021. Covering important occasions will help you connect with your audience and watch your follower count go up.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some <em><u>great<\/u><\/em> examples to help you get inspired:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-21.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2461\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-21.png\" alt=\"1\" width=\"546\" height=\"533\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2462\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog3.png\" alt=\"2\" width=\"541\" height=\"593\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Plan ahead to ensure you don\u2019t miss out on an important event or holiday. Since you can\u2019t plan trends in advance, make sure you have a team ready to create content for trends that develop within a matter of hours. This will help you stay on top of things!<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc61021489\"><\/a>9. Encourage Your Employees to Join the Action<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to growing your business via LinkedIn, your company page isn\u2019t the only page that should be spruced up and optimized at all times.<\/p>\n<p>We touched upon Puma\u2019s custom hashtag (#PUMAFam) earlier. If you browse through the hashtag on LinkedIn, you\u2019ll come across <em>a plethora of posts<\/em>, and not all of them come from their company page!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, their managers and employees have also joined the action to keep the momentum going.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a glimpse:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-22.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2463\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-22.png\" alt=\"puma\" width=\"539\" height=\"853\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em><u>This<\/u><\/em> is team effort at a glance. And when it comes to succeeding on LinkedIn, you can\u2019t run a tight ship on your own. You <em><u>have<\/u><\/em> to recruit the rest of your team to help grow your company page and crystallize your online presence on the mega platform.<\/p>\n<p>Encourage your team to share frequent posts that reflect your company in a positive light. They can share behind-the-scenes images, repost your company\u2019s posts, and help custom hashtags do even better. You can also request them to engage with your posts to improve their reach. Collectively, these strategies will go a long way in helping your company page grow.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc61021490\"><\/a>10. Actively Participate in LinkedIn Groups<\/h3>\n<p>Looking to connect with likeminded individuals in your industry? And we don\u2019t mean your competitors, we mean thought leaders and industry insiders who are passionate about the same products\/services\/ideas\/strategies. If you\u2019re nodding your head in the affirmative, make sure you join relevant LinkedIn groups.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-23.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2464\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/blog2-23.png\" alt=\"groups\" width=\"771\" height=\"485\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As you engage in niche-specific conversations, you\u2019ll manage to reflect your company\u2019s expertise and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/310427\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">create awareness for your brand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You can also start your own group and share your content (blogs, articles, etc.). It\u2019s a little more work, but <em><u>it\u2019s worth it<\/u><\/em>. As the group gains momentum, you\u2019ll marvel at how much traffic it generates for your company page.<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc61021491\"><\/a>11. Use LinkedIn Sponsored Ads<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re still frowning upon your LinkedIn follower count, it\u2019s time to let the professionals take care of things for you. Over the years, LinkedIn sponsored ads have become a go-to for thousands of companies across the platform. You can choose from a wide range of ads depending on the specific goal you want to reach. Whether you want to prompt more visits to your page, increase reach, or boost conversions, you can select the right ads accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Take your time to acclimatize to the purpose of each ad. Once you have a good grasp on the ins and outs of LinkedIn advertising, you\u2019ll manage to make an informed decision that pays off in the long run!<\/p>\n<h3><a name=\"_Toc61021492\"><\/a>12. Promote Your LinkedIn Page on Social Media and Your Website<\/h3>\n<p>While you can take several measures to promote your LinkedIn profile on the platform itself, you also need to branch out into other platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing your LinkedIn profile on social media is a great way to target a different audience that wouldn\u2019t normally discover your company page on LinkedIn. In addition, we recommend linking your LinkedIn page on the \u201chome\u201d and \u201ccontact\u201d pages of your website.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc61021493\"><\/a>Wrapping Up!<\/h2>\n<p>In this blog, we delved deep into the top LinkedIn marketing tips that can help you increase followers in 2021.
