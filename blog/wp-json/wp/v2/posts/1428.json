You can illustrate the pain point for a potential customer, demonstrating that you understand their problem.<\/p>\n<p>Then you have the space to hit them with your solution &#8211; your product and\/or services.<\/p>\n<p>This strategy of illustrating the problem and introducing your product or service as a solution will serve to boost your lead generation efforts through digital marketing significantly.<\/p>\n<p>In order to fully provide an accurate representation of a customer&#8217;s pain point, you need to factor in their search intent.<\/p>\n<h4>Focusing on Searcher\u2019s Intent<\/h4>\n<p>Google no longer uses keyword-matching to rank pages in search results; it\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/faculty.ist.psu.edu\/jjansen\/academic\/pubs\/jansen_user_intent.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">analyzes the\u00a0<em>searcher\u2019s intent<\/em><\/a><\/u>\u00a0through the search query\u2019s context\u2014the \u2018why\u2019 behind the search query.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the question you need to be asking: <em>What does the customer want from their query?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Algorithms now measure how well your content matches the visitor\u2019s search intent.

Go through the \u201cPeople may ask\u201d section to gain a better understanding of searcher\u2019s intent.<\/p>\n<p>The four most common types of searcher&#8217;s intent include: informational, commercial, navigational, and transactional.<\/p>\n<p>At each stage of the user&#8217;s search intent, you want to give the user what they are searching for while subtly mentioning your own product\/service or having a lead magnet embedded within your content to help guide them.<\/p>\n<p>Help people find what they are intentionally looking for.<\/p>\n<p>One key way to identify intent is to literally look at each keyword or key search term you want to target and think about what intent could be going through a user&#8217;s head when they are searching that word or phrase.<\/p>\n<p>Then, where relevant, give it to them and, in turn, maximize your own lead generation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, there are tons of tools out there that can help you identify valuable keywords.<\/p>\n<h4>Updated And Unique Content Is Key!<\/h4>\n<p>Steer clear from duplicate content. According to the\u00a0<em>Google Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines, content that is copied with little or no effort, time and manual curation is rated\u00a0<strong>lowest in search rankings!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Make sure that you not only publish unique content that adds value, but also periodically review your articles and blog posts to make sure the information is up-to-date.<\/p>\n<p>Unmaintained websites with misleading content are the primary reason why websites have low E-A-T (expertise, authority and trustworthiness) ratings.<\/p>\n<h3>b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Optimizing For Local SEO<\/h3>\n<p>Businesses that have local service areas or a brick-and-mortar presence need to pay special attention to local SEO.

It displays ads to your targeted audience at the same time when they\u2019re looking for your service or product.<\/p>\n<p>If launched strategically, your PPC campaign can help you reach qualified leads and generate considerable revenue within a short period of time.<\/p>\n<h3>What is PPC?<\/h3>\n<p>PPC is an advertising model where advertisers pay every time a visitor clicks on their online ad. It gives brands the opportunity to feature their service\/product on top of the search page results.<\/p>\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1435\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"337\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One of the most common types of PPC ads are paid search ads. They appear when visitors perform commercial searches. This can be anything for a local service search, such as someone looking for a plumber in the area, or a user looking for high-end products like ERP software. All these searches trigger PPC ads.<\/p>\n<p>However, there\u2019s a catch: businesses can\u2019t simply pay for their ads to appear on top of search results; instead, there\u2019s an automated bidding system in place, called the\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescommunicationscouncil\/2019\/09\/17\/understanding-header-bidding-and-how-to-leverage-it\/#7298ef495c18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ad Auction<\/a><\/u>, where businesses place bids on keywords relevant to their business.<\/p>\n<p>So, when the searcher submits their query to the search engine, a complex algorithm works to display ads based on the advertisements\u2019 relevance and validity.<\/p>\n<h3>Generate Immediate Results with PPC<\/h3>\n<p>While SEO is a great long-term strategy to drive web traffic, PPC has the power to deliver immediate results the moment your ad campaign goes live is posted on the internet. With a good score and a good bid, your ad can instantaneously get on top of sponsored listings, delivering targeted traffic to product launches, limited time offers, special promotions and other projects that are time-sensitive.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1439\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/b2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"250\" \/><\/p>\n<p>People looking for these specific brands respond instantly to these targeted ads and convert when directed to the brand\u2019s landing page.<\/p>\n<p>The best part is that the bidding on specific keywords costs a lot less than generic keywords that other online marketers are also bidding for.<\/p>\n<p>PPC data is invaluable in terms of improved conversions, both in optimizing existing web pages and initial SEO planning. This is because paid search can direct users to sites that don\u2019t currently rank.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1436\" src=\"https:\/\/www.searchberg.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"892\" height=\"588\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Guest Blogging<\/h2>\n<p>Ask any savvy marketer and they\u2019ll tell you that blogging is a vital tool that attracts the right audience to your website.<\/p>\n<h3>What is Guest Blogging?<\/h3>\n<p>Also called \u201cguest posting,\u201d guest blogging is the process of writing unique and specialized content for another company\u2019s site.

Additionally, the promotional boost doesn\u2019t hurt either.<\/p>\n<h3>Helps Stimulate Social Media Shares and Following<\/h3>\n<p>A great way to extend your online reach is to generate social media shares.
