General Ranking Factors</h3><p>In this section, participants are asked, “In your opinion, to what extent do each of the following thematic clusters contribute to rankings across result types at Google?” They then enter a percentage of influence for each of these eight thematic areas, for both local pack/finder results and local organic results:</p><ul><li>Google My Business signals (proximity, categories, keyword in business title, etc.)</li><li>Citation signals (IYP/Aggregator NAP consistency, citation volume, etc.)</li><li>On-page signals (presence of NAP, keywords in titles, Domain Authority, etc.)</li><li>Link signals (inbound anchor text, linking Domain Authority, linking domain quantity, etc.)</li><li>Review signals (review quantity, review velocity, review diversity, etc.)</li><li>Social signals (Google engagement, Facebook engagement, Twitter engagement, etc.)</li><li>Behavioral/mobile signals (click-through rate, mobile clicks to call, dwell time, etc.)</li><li>Personalization</li></ul><p>The results here give us a sense of which general ranking factor areas are more important than others.</p><h3>II. Specific Ranking Factors</h3><p>In part A of this section, I asked the experts to rank the top 20 individual ranking factors (out of a total list of 137) that have the biggest impact on pack/finder rankings.</p><p>In part B of this section, I asked them to rank the top 20 factors from the same list, only this time to rank them based on impact on localized organic rankings.</p><p>Results are then tabulated via inverse scoring, where the number one-ranked factor received the most points for that question, and the lowest-ranked factor received the fewest points. (The factors ranking outside the top 20 for all respondents ended up with zero points.)</p><h3>III. Foundational vs Competitive Factors</h3><p>In this section, I asked the experts to rank the 10 factors they think are the most important foundational ranking factors, and to rank the 10 factors they think are competitive difference makers.</p><p>Results are then tabulated via inverse scoring, where the #1 ranked factor received the most points for that question, and the lowest-ranked factor received the fewest points. (The factors ranking outside the top 10 for all respondents ended up with zero points.)</p><h3>IV. Focusing on More and Focusing on Less</h3><p>Here, I asked the experts to rank the five factors they were focusing on more in the past year, and the five factors they were focusing on less in the past year.</p><p>Results were then tabulated via inverse scoring, where the #1 ranked factor received the most "points" for that question, and the lowest-ranked factor received the fewest points. (The factors ranking outside the top 5 for all respondents ended up with zero points.)</p><h3>V. Negative Ranking Factors</h3><p>In this section, I asked the experts to rank 34 negative factors in order of most damaging to most benign.</p></div><a name="discussion"></a><div class="col-12 page-type-content mb-4"><h3>Discussion</h3><p>Please see my analysis and summary of the results <a href="/blog/2018-local-search-ranking-factors-survey">here on the Moz blog</a>.

The control you have over the messaging allows for a lot of creativity. In particular, we are seeing traction in cases where branded searches are "leaking" clicks to other domains in the SERPs. GMB Posts are a great way to attract more engagement and clicks from potential customers who are already searching for your brand and may be in buying mode. With SEO, it's often the case that there's just as much opportunity to milk the keywords you already rank well for as there is in going after new keywords. We are also seeing a lot of improvement with multi-location brands where we are rewriting location pages to be more relevant. It doesn't matter if you have two locations or 2,000. This tactic can improve existing rankings as well as make it eligible to rank for additional queries.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/andykuiper">Andy Kuiper</a>, Andy Kuiper Internet Marketing:</p><p>Seeking a consistent flow of positive-sentiment reviews on your GMB page. BBB listings *surprising find* paid/unpaid doesn't seem to matter. Ensure as much completeness and engagement of the GMB page as possible.<br /></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DirectiveAgency">Andy Monte</a>, Directive Consulting:</p><p>Targeting specific, long-tail keywords that have a high amount of "related keywords" associated with them is a great tactic to make sure you show up in the SERP. If the keyword is long-tail and specific enough, ranking usually isn't too difficult (however, usually these keywords have a low search volume), but if you can find ones with a fair amount of "related keywords" - you can actually rank for most of those related keywords and get traffic from them as well, which usually more than makes up for the low search volume. <br /><br />I remember targeting one keyword that had a monthly search volume of 30, but because there were over 200 "related keywords," I was able to rank for all of them. After the first month of being published, that one page now generates over 2,000 organic users a month.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheSocialDude">Ben Fisher</a>, Steady Demand:</p><p>1. Convincing clients to have a physical location that is located in the city in which they want to rank for has worked out very well. I use the method of starring the current location on maps, then searching the city name in maps.google.com. It is very easy to see the city boundaries. Once a client moves (or adds a new location) to be within the boundaries we see an increase in calls and visibility. <br /><br />2. Semantically rich content in GMB Posts and G+ content/engagement has proven to still be effective (editor’s note: G+ shutdown announced). The more you can do to teach Google about your business, the better off you are going to be. We have done case studies that show how these activities can influence ranking: Google Posts Impact Ranking [Case Study] and Local SEO Boost with Mike Blumenthal [Case Study].<br /><br />3. Native reviews on GMB still have a high impact on ranking. Reviews (along with an owner’s response) show that consumers trust a business, and trust is a foundational factor in ranking. <br /><br />4. Attacking spam is a great tactic. Not only does it help clean up Google Maps, but the effect on your client’s ranking is almost instantaneous. This does not work in every industry, but for lawyers and service-area-businesses like HVAC, it is highly effective since spam is so prevalent there. Location spam is pretty easy to detect and remove, but business name spam, not so much.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/blakedenman">Blake Denman</a>, RicketyRoo Inc.:</p><p>Local brand building: For roughly the last 18 months, we've been shifting the conversation with clients from link building to local brand building. Instead of just focusing on the overall value of a link or link building strategy, we're finding ways of getting a local brand involved with the local community that will also earn links, social shares, and gets the brand in front of potential customers.</p><p>Reviews: We all know that reviews are critical to any local business. We've found that different strategies work for different clients. Some clients do great with a third-party tool like GatherUp while others do much better with SMS review building. Incentivizing employees is also a tactic that works well in some industries. You can give a bonus to individuals if a review mentions their name or make it a bonus for the entire team<br /></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brianbarwig">Brian Barwig</a>, AttorneySync:</p><p>Local link building. Find local links that are relevant to the site you are building links for.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/being_smith">Brian Smith</a>, Rio SEO:</p><p>We have had success in providing relevant real-time material that expands a brand's ability to connect with users beyond NAP. Items that we have focused on this past year include. <br />- Expanding content to include localized items like landmarks, historical buildings, and popular streets/highways.<br />- Monitoring and responding to reviews to help influence consumer journey in discovering local businesses. <br />- Publishing local events to engage consumers and expand content on local landing pages.<br />- Google Posts and it's ability to showcase promotions and increase local visibility beyond ranking.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CarrieHill">Carrie Hill</a>, Ignitor Digital Marketing, Inc.:</p><p>(Depending upon market and niche) Cleaning up GMB listings for competitors by reporting GMB listing spam, review spam, and editing listings that are keyword stuffing is pretty effective for us. <br />Aligning GMB Category, landing page content/optimization, and making sure addresses/phone numbers are consistent from GMB to all pages/locations on website. <br />It's really surprising how just the simplest things make a big difference.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/caseymeraz">Casey Meraz</a>,	Juris Digital:</p><p>Working in competitive legal niches where there is a lot of spam we tend to focus a lot of our efforts on link building and earning links to Google My Business landing page URLs. The strategy that has had the biggest impact is getting links from locally relevant and authoritative websites. The best links come from the same niche and domains serving the city our clients are in. Typically the strategies we focus most on are community driven events with promotion and outreach such as free cab ride programs on holidays which is a great PR and link building tactic when executed correctly. <br /><br />There is a lot of spam and the problem is growing with Google My Business listings. Another competitive tactic is to constantly search for keywords your clients want to rank for. When you see spammy listings you need to report them right away and keep doing so every time you see them. When spammers are beating you or ranking for keywords they shouldn't you can really have a positive impact on local pack rankings just by reporting spam. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ColanNielsen">Colan Nielson</a>,	 Sterling Sky:</p><p>Internal linking is still very effective for both local organic and local pack rankings. We have seen several cases where adding an internal link in the right place has boosted rankings almost immediately.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ConradSaam">Conrad Saam</a>, Mockingbird Marketing:</p><p>I've been having a lot of success emphasizing Google reviews and removing superfluous content across sites.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/corigraft">Cori Graft</a>, Seer Interactive:</p><p>Good, old-fashioned link building seems to have improved local pack performance even more this year than in recent memory, which supports the theory that Google continues to bring the local and traditional algorithms / ranking signals more closely together. What we're calling "Behavioral" signals in this survey also continue to help results — specifically, driving branded search interest. We've seen a strong correlation between branded search activity and improved rankings in both pack and localized organic rankings.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/danleibson">Dan Leibson</a>, Local SEO Guide:</p><p>Really we are focused on more or less the same stuff as always:<br /><br />- Is Google properly crawling and indexing your site?<br />- Is your site relevant and authoritative for your vertical and geo?<br />- Do you have pages targeting the search queries you want to rank for?<br />- Do you have a competitively strong backlink profile?<br />- How does your Google My Business profile(s) look?<br /><br />Depending on the answers, a technical SEO audit, content strategy/creation/marketing, or link building may be the best bet.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/danaditomaso">Dana DiTomaso</a>, Kick Point:</p><p>Google Posts! We've seen gains for clients in competitive niches after consistent posting. The posts don't have to link to their site, but it appears that they should be topical and posted consistently.<br /></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidmihm">David Mihm</a>, ThriveHive / Tidings:</p><p>In the search results I look at regularly, I continue to see reviews playing a larger and larger role. Much as citations became table stakes over the last couple of years, reviews now appear to be on their way to becoming table stakes as well. The local packs for mid-to-large metro areas, and even industries where ranking in the 3-pack used to be possible with just a handful of reviews or no reviews, now feature businesses with dozens of reviews at a minimum — many within the last few months. This speaks to the importance of a steady stream of feedback.<br /><br />Whether the increased ranking is due to review volume, keywords in review content, or the increased clickthrough rate those gold stars yield, I doubt we'll ever know for sure. I just know that for most businesses, it's the area of local SEO I'd invest the most time and effort into getting right — and done well, should also have a much more important flywheel effect of helping you build a better business, as the guys at GatherUp have been talking about for years.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidWallace">David Wallace</a>, Search Rank:</p><p>Besides foundational tactics such as having a verified and complete GMB listing with matching NAP across both GMB listings, website and local search data sources (e.g. Yelp, Foursquare, etc.), strategies and tactics that have been working well as of late include making sites secure (https), ensuring that they load quickly (pagespeed), making sure they are responsive for desktop, tablets &amp; mobile, and continuing to develop quality content that is relevant to business and interesting/resourceful enough to generates social shares as well as attract inbound links.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/devbasu">Dev Basu</a>, Powered By Search:</p><p>Because citations are largely commoditized at this point and are therefore table stakes, we've been getting great mileage from focusing on local link building at scale by supporting events, publications, and associations that are the pillars of the local community.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ericrohrback">Eric Rohrback</a>, RedShift:</p><p>Local landing/location pages still work very well. If there are searches you're targeting that have local intent, creating a specific page for the office can help battle stronger domains (especially if they do not have any local/office pages). <br /><br />Writing specific schema markup (JSON is easiest to manage), can give some separation if everything else is equal but won't be something that will move the site from page 2 to top of 1. <br /><br />Site speed optimization and technical optimization have always worked, and will continue to be an important part of our job. Optimizing internal linking, page content, markup, and reducing problems like broken links or redirect chains each month has been a key part of our client work.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/greggifford">Greg Gifford</a>, DealerOn:</p><p>For us, geo optimization is still killing it. Lots of Local SEOs say it's old school and doesn't matter, but for almost all of our clients, it still makes a massive difference. We concentrate more on geo-relevance of the entire base of content on the site, not just throwing location keywords into titles/h1s/etc. Local links are a huge game changer as well. But, for "new" things that are really killing it, we're having amazing success with Google Posts.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gyitsakalakis">Gyi Tsakalakis</a>, AttorneySync:</p><p>Meh, links. In other words, topically and locally relevant links continue to work particularly well. Not only do these links tend to improve visibility in both local packs and traditional results, they're also particularly effective for improving targeted traffic, leads, and customers. Find ways to earn links on the sites your local audience uses. These typically include local news, community, and blog sites.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/headley">Joel Headley</a>, Patient Pop:</p><p>Reviews: soliciting reviews across a diverse number of sites while creating fresh content through reviews/testimonials on-site or via third-party publishers.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JoyanneHawkins">Joy Hawkins</a>, Sterling Sky:</p><p>Using a review tool to ask every customer to leave you a review is a necessary element these days. We've also had a ton of success consolidating content and improving the overall quality of content on SMB sites. Of course, eliminating spam is also a high-impact strategy we use a lot. We have also seen some huge wins from setting up better internal linking structures on sites. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/acorninternet">Lisa Kolb</a>, Acorn Internet Services, Inc.:</p><p>The travel/lodging industry is so different from other business types. We have been forced to place a high importance on Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) and Google Hotel Finder (GHF) participation for our clients' Local Pack and Maps listings. Without OTA and GHF availability, it is virtually impossible to rank in competitive areas for the 3-pack, and difficult to place higher than competitors in the top 10 results in the Maps listings.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/marcusbowlerhat">Marcus Miller</a>, Bowler Hat:</p><p>Building domain authority seems to be the area where we have most focus recently. I think this is in part due to a shift towards more traditional signals (in addition to foundational Local SEO signals) but also due to the maturity in the marketplace. Once everyone has their content, technical SEO, and local SEO dialed in, authority building is the next logical step.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/marybowling">Mary Bowling</a>,	ignitordigital.com:</p><p>1. Eliminating thin content by removing or combing pages. <br />2. Eliminating worthless content by looking at Google Analytics and Search Console for unvisited pages.<br />3. Beefing up internal links and CTAs on well-visited pages.<br />4. Cleaning up the technical messes caused by http/https, canonicalization, redirects, robots.txt/NoIndex, inaccurate sitemaps, broken links, etc. <br />5. Improving internal linking, especially on sites built with a very flat structure.<br />6. Improving and optimizing WordPress category pages.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mblumenthal">Mike Blumenthal</a>, GatherUp:</p><p>Well, I don't use them but a solid name spam is still very useful....</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Miriam_Ellis_">Miriam Ellis</a>, Moz &amp; Solas Web Design:</p><p>Full management of the GMB listing, including Post, Photos, Q&amp;A, Reviews, etc. Unfortunately, I also see undetected/un-punished spam tactics working well for local businesses.<br /><br />I would also predict that 2019 is the year in which we will all start exploring unstructured citations/linktations to their fullest. These plum mentions in high authority local/industry publications are rewarding!<br /><br />And, despite Google's de-emphasis of free, organic website results over time, keep investing in topical content development. It feeds both your local and organic rankings.<br /><br />Finally, though you will encounter articles saying, "This factor isn't working anymore," don't overlook table stakes, like basic citation accuracy and monitoring. They may not be especially exciting, but they are your ante in. Once you have the basics in place, you can bring your more creative marketing ideas into play.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nickpierno">Nick Pierno</a>, Whitespark:</p><p>- High volume of content on home/landing/service pages (with good page layout and design, so users aren't simply landing on a wall of text)<br />- Super prominent contact forms and phone numbers (seems obvious, but still so often overlooked)<br />- Working with businesses that actually have their keywords/locations in their DBA :P<br /></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/philrozek">Phil Rozek</a>, Local Visibility System, LLC:</p><p>On top of the pillars of link-earning, review-rustling, and getting half-decent copy onto clients’ sites, two things:<br /><br />1. What I call “spam patrol”: submitting user edits on spammy competitors’ GMB listings so that they play by the same rules you do. If your edits (most likely, edits to the business name) get approved, competitors’ rankings won’t go down right away, and they probably won’t go down as much as you’d have liked, but you will have an effect over time. Thin the herd enough and you may see that newcomers and would-be spammers are deterred. <br /><br />2. In-depth content on your “niche” services. Every year I think I’m about to see the end of ranking for those with relative ease. Every year I’m amazed at how few businesses got the memo. That’s an opportunity for you, especially given that Google seems to return local-pack results for more and weirder search terms every year. Sprinkle some of that niche content on your homepage or other “big” pages, and err on the side of internal linking to it generously.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/searchinfluence">Search Influence Team</a>, Search Influence:</p><p>I have seen visibility improve when following Google's lead. In other words, they rolled out the Posts feature broadly and I have seen activity on the listings increase as a result. Furthermore, they have added business descriptions, attributes, and other features over the past year or so. It is overwhelmingly obvious advice to use the fields Google rolls out but it is also the most effective in my experience. <br /><br />The addition of photos and videos seems to have a positive impact as well. With the metrics for photos included in the GMB insights it makes sense to expand the quality and quantity of photos used on listings. <br /><br />One thing that is hard to quantify, at least in the way this survey is formatted, is that Google wants users and the owners of listings to be active. In other words, using the listings as a business hub, à la Yelp. By managing the listings more proactively (answering questions, utilizing posts, responding to reviews) you are sending some signals locally that you are engaging with customers as well as actively maintaining your listing information. I think this is as relevant as anything since Google is moving to keep us on Google services longer without a site click-through.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/GuideTwit">Tim Capper</a>, Online Ownership:</p><p>In the travel market, in-depth city / attraction guides with integrated walking maps are working well - attracting visits and links.<br /><br />For the health market (after medic) tracking down and properly attributing research, conference, and science papers has resulted in a significant increase in positions and traffic.<br /><br />In the manufacturing sector, published tech specs and guides are still working well.</p></div><a name="what-are-some-strategies-tactics-that-used-to-work-well-but-dont-seem-to-work-anymore"></a><div class="col-12 page-type-content mb-4"><h3>What are some strategies/tactics that used to work well, but don’t seem to work anymore?</h3><p><a href="https://twitter.com/phixed">Adam Dorfman</a>, Reputation.com:</p><p>I'm much more interested in building out and optimizing structured content on our client's owned assets than I am on third party sites. They are both important but there is much more opportunity to increase your visibility within Google's search results by focusing on the former.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/localseoguide">Andrew Shotland</a>, LocalSEOGuide.com:</p><p>Depending on the strength of the domain, we are also seeing taxonomy expansion (a fancy name for adding more "service+city" pages) either performing well or destroying sites. If you have a weak domain, this could be a quick way to make it even weaker by adding a lot more thin URLs to it. We have seen several post-Medic cases of sites that got obliterated for what appears to be too much "topical overlap." So test, test, test. I am still surprised when I see "insert city name here" boilerplate content on location pages. It can work, but if your location pages aren't ranking well, this is one of the first issues I'd investigate.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/andykuiper">Andy Kuiper</a>, Andy Kuiper Internet Marketing:</p><p>Focusing too much on citations being 'perfect' — even close seems to be OK nowadays.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DirectiveAgency">Andy Monte</a>, Directive Consulting:</p><p>Leveraging directories and data aggregators as the sole form of link building just doesn't work anymore as a long-term link building tactic. Fortunately, this is still a great foundational strategy to work on for any company, but even then, it only really moves the needle for low-authority domains.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheSocialDude">Ben Fisher</a>, Steady Demand:</p><p>Google is cracking down harder on businesses that consistently employ spammy tactics. I have witnessed companies that have a mixture of real and spammy listings get a wholesale penalty to all their listings based on those tactics. Many companies are spamming the heck out of their GMB listings to gain a short-term ranking boost, and why not, it works for their competitors. But, I have also seen companies get a hard suspension based on this behavior. <br /><br />Google's algorithm is just not yet savvy enough to detect virtual offices or *gasp* keyword-stuffed GMB listings. However, they are a machine learning first company and I think they may get better at detecting spam over time. <br /><br />The big thing I feel is not working anymore is citation building as the only way to build links. Correct NAP across the top citation sources is the foundation, but adding 100's of other structured citations from low-level websites/directories will not cut it. I like to encourage focusing on where your customers are. Facebook Yelp, Bing, Uber, Waze, and Here, along with niche authority directories like Avvo, Apartments.com, etc.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/blakedenman">Blake Denman</a>, RicketyRoo Inc.:</p><p>Citations as a sole means of getting into the local pack. Years ago you could build out a few hundred structured citations and rank pretty well. Now, we take care of the primary data aggregators and tier 1 citation sources.

We ran a test this year to see what kind of an impact adding the phone number has. The conclusion is that having a phone number in the title tag does not drive more calls. In the test we ran it drove one call in 60 days (we tracked the number using Call Tracking Metrics). However, what it did do is increase the CTR from 1.5% to 4.8% compared to the previous period. Conversions also increased (2 vs. 0) over the previous period. So, although I don't think that adding a phone number to a title tag will increase calls or ranking, it can lead to increased CTR and conversions. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ConradSaam">Conrad Saam</a>, Mockingbird Marketing:</p><p>Adding content for the sake of adding content.

With competition from the OTAs and Google's persistence to sell those OTA rooms for a fee, a proven, individualized strategy is now imperative to survive. Your website, blogging, and social media, although foundational items in the past, are no longer producing the same ROI.

Being a TC may make me skew towards Google My Business.

If your overall review "portfolio" is a dumpster fire, well, your on-site is moot.<br />Reviews vs. Links: You can't build enough quality links to outrank a shitty reputation.<br />Reviews vs. Behavioral: If your review "portfolio" is inherently negative, the behavior is already set.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brianbarwig">Brian Barwig</a>, AttorneySync:</p><p>Links.

I think I'd worry about reviews if I had to pick only ONE thing - because the byproduct of a really great review profile is happy return customers, WOM traffic, unstructured and structured citations/mentions on 3rd party review sites that usually have pretty high domain authority, and getting a complete GMB listing is a one-off that I'd hope would be done anyway — even if it's not sticking to your ONE area requirement.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/caseymeraz">Casey Meraz</a>,	Juris Digital:</p><p>Links — this is also because it will have a positive effect on organic rankings as well.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ColanNielsen">Colan Nielson</a>,	 Sterling Sky:</p><p>I'd have to go with reviews. Reviews have become so much more important over the last few years and this trend is not going to change any time soon.

Only focusing on one of these would be a poor decision for most clients. Search is client/market specific. Investing in citations for a search-mature, 500-location business is likely a giant waste of money, but might actually be a cost-effective strategy for an SMB. On the flip side, on-page site optimizations and complicated feature deployment may be easy for a large brand (please point me in that prospect’s direction). While an SMB might not even have any resource to engage in website development.

This question totally depends on the competitiveness of the market and what a business has already done to date. For businesses that are just getting started with SEO, I'd 100% start with GMB. Google has released so many rich features in the last 18 months that there's a ton you can do in Google My Business alone, even if all that ends up doing is increasing your conversion rate from branded searches.<br /><br />For more competitive markets it'd be a combination of reviews and behavioral signals.<br /><br />No question that links still matter today, but as we see fewer and fewer website results and more and more Knowledge Panels, I think they're a shorter-term tactic in terms of the timespan of ROI.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidWallace">David Wallace</a>, Search Rank:</p><p>The most important thing for local search in my opinion is a verified and complete GMB listing, which of course is needed in the first place and this followed by making sure business is represented across all major data sources with complete and matching information (NAP, categories, etc.).

It's tough to get links without good content, but you can't get great traffic without links.

Where budget is super tight we would always conduct an audit and SWOT analysis to determine where to best direct our efforts.

The problem with content strategy is that it is best executed when done in a team together with the business. The business manager knows best what his business can and cannot do, what their clients want or don't want, what the most common questions are and what the best answers to these questions are. With high-quality content, and most importantly relevant content, many other factors come into place naturally — social media mentions, links, and brand mentions.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/philrozek">Phil Rozek</a>, Local Visibility System, LLC:</p><p>Reviews. Reviews are the one part of local SEO you can never exhaust or see diminishing returns on. They’re the one part of your marketing you can always improve, and where you’re never “good enough.” Your GMB, citation, and on-site work taper off after a while. Strictly in terms of big dumb rankings, links matter more than reviews do. However, with links you only need to do better than your competitors — links won’t pay your bills. No customer ever picked a business because of its links.<br /><br />If I had to pick one goal for you in your review-gathering effort, it would be: how much detail can you get your customers / clients / patients to go into?</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/searchinfluence">Search Influence Team</a>, Search Influence:</p><p>I am teetering between GMB and on-page factors. If forced to choose, I would go with GMB since you can generate a "website" within GMB, although you have minimal impact over the on-page factors. <br /><br />Reasons:<br />- In terms of local search, Google is obviously king. I would use their tools to best position my business.<br />- If the goal is to keep you on Google, using GMB to convert customers makes sense. <br />- On-page work can help you across a lot of SEO, but if the long term focus is on local search, then you must be providing effective listing information. <br />- The rest of these factors are only a small part of getting people in front of your listing / site. It makes sense to start here since it has the most visibility in terms of local searchers. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/GuideTwit">Tim Capper</a>, Online Ownership:</p><p>Onsite, because I could influence behavior, reviews, and attract links.</p></div><a name="what-are-some-methods-youre-using-to-try-to-influence-behavioral-factors-if-any"></a><div class="col-12 page-type-content mb-4"><h3>What are some methods you’re using to try to influence behavioral factors, if any?</h3><p><a href="https://twitter.com/localseoguide">Andrew Shotland</a>, LocalSEOGuide.com:</p><p>We have lately been asking our clients to post stuff about the Supreme Court Justice selection process, but that doesn't seem to be flying, so we are pretty much stuck with optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, images and video, adding structured markup, etc.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/andykuiper">Andy Kuiper</a>, Andy Kuiper Internet Marketing:</p><p>Trying to get my clients to use GMB Posts, respond appropriately to GMB reviews, and to pay attention to GMB Q&amp;As.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DirectiveAgency">Andy Monte</a>, Directive Consulting:</p><p>We have run some A/B tests that involved tweaking and adjusting GMB titles to improve rankings in the local pack and CTR.

Searchers dwell for minutes (hours?) at a time on both positive and negative reviews. They click on them. They even share them socially. They definitely utilize reviews to inform their buyer's journey.

No comment for this local survey but I just wrote a blog post for the Reputation.com website that should go up next week on Google's 20th anniversary announcement. In short, it's the same story of Google trying to control all information people require whether they are actively looking for it or not.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/localseoguide">Andrew Shotland</a>, LocalSEOGuide.com:</p><p>It's pretty clear that Google is going to continue to increase the time searchers spend within Google's systems at the expense of sending them to your site. The good news for you is that Google is really great at building incredibly complex systems that tend to break. So on the one hand, you've got SkyNet seemingly going sentient. On the other hand, SkyNet seems less intent on destroying humanity than it is on replacing our client's GMB photos with cat pictures. In SEO, we are all John Connors.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/andykuiper">Andy Kuiper</a>, Andy Kuiper Internet Marketing:</p><p>I think Google is trying to get SMBs comfortable with using the GMB backend. I see a future where SMBs will be using a GMB app every day — for dealing with leads, handling appointments, responding to reviews and Q&amp;As... and in the not-so-distant future, perhaps even handling financial transactions via the app.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DirectiveAgency">Andy Monte</a>, Directive Consulting:</p><p>Overall, Google seems to be adding more value and authority to factors that aren't in our control such as links, reviews, and user engagement metrics. I'm sure this stems from cracking down on spammy SEO tactics, but nevertheless, this is going to affect the SERP and in turn, change the way that we approach clients with on-page tactics.<br /><br />Aside from that, Ads and Featured Snippets are becoming more and more prevalent in the local search landscape, so as SEOs, we can no longer silo our efforts into "SEO" and "PPC," but need to do a better job of creating a cohesive digital marketing strategy for our clients that leverage both the organic and paid channels to achieve our goals.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheSocialDude">Ben Fisher</a>, Steady Demand:</p><p>Becoming not as link-dependent:<br />Google has been transitioning away from links being a key determining factor since 2013 to a more semantic/trust/KP approach. Since they are a mobile-first company and moving more toward the single-answer solution, Google has been developing ranking factors that are not so link dependent. Semantic content, in-store visits/transactions, and third-party validation are much more important. Even the website I feel in time will become less important as it is one of the weaker trustworthy sources. <br /><br />Emphasis on Google My Business:<br />I would not be surprised if we see the evolution of GMB accelerating. It is feasible that we will see more options come to businesses that continue to enhance the transactional layer that Google has become. Will we see more booking/appointment options come to service-based businesses? Tighter integrations into other Google products? Posts will continue to grow with new features. User-generated content like Q&amp;A will become more frequent.<br /><br />Greater focus on local: <br />Google's focus has always been answering a user’s question directly on the SERP. With the continued rise of mobile and even digital assistants (which is still wonky and young), we are moving closer to a place where there will be little-to-no friction for a user to find an answer and make a transaction. Local plays a major role in this. Get a ticket for movies, make an appointment, purchase a product for retail, book a table for restaurants, and get a quote for home services, see a local business inventory. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/blakedenman">Blake Denman</a>, RicketyRoo Inc.:</p><p>More features rolled out to Google My Business. More importance on the sentiment, reviewer authority, and words associated inside of reviews to influence ranking. Links are still going to be important, but businesses should focus on topical or locally relevant websites. Businesses should also focus more and more on structured data.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brianbarwig">Brian Barwig</a>, AttorneySync:</p><p>Trying to get away from links but that is going to be a while.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/being_smith">Brian Smith</a>, Rio SEO:</p><p>Google continues to minimize the user's time spent on a brand's/company's website. In general, Google seeks to provide all aspects of what a consumer needs to know about a local business by adding an array of information into its Knowledge Panel for users to consume.<br /><br />These moves are all great for user experience, but it presents new challenges to the modern day brand marketer on how you set yourself apart from the stable of competition that operates within your local market.<br /><br />Personalization factors on a business's website become even more critical moving forward, as Google My Business becomes a new homepage for your business. Items like business events, appointment bookings, 1st party customer reviews, and ordering become more of a mainstay instead of leading edge within the business vertical you serve.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CarrieHill">Carrie Hill</a>, Ignitor Digital Marketing, Inc.:</p><p>I think Google is going to continue to push things they can monetize.

In other words, business owners will need to invest a significant amount of effort optimizing their "Google Homepage" and less emphasis on their actual website.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ConradSaam">Conrad Saam</a>, Mockingbird Marketing:</p><p>If the trend continues, Google will keep making way for ads and push down organic results. Although this can only go so far, since Google must on some level appreciate the importance of balancing organic and paid search results to keep user trust.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/corigraft">Cori Graft</a>, Seer Interactive:</p><p>Nearly all of Google's recent updates to Maps and GMB features are focused on getting people to interact more and communicate better with businesses through listings and Search. Q&amp;A, updates to their Reviews guidelines, Messaging, User-Submitted Attributes, Posts, "Popular Times"... all of these features aim to accomplish the same general goal: to give consumers a more direct way to make informed decisions about where to visit through Search. I'm not convinced that the algorithm is as advanced as we SEOs like to think it is with regard to actually processing these behavioral signals, but I believe that based on Google's recent feature releases, it will be soon enough.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Google wants to help its users have the best possible experience. I believe businesses who take advantage of these opportunities to connect with customers, answer their questions, and truly build a connection will be rewarded in Search and IRL.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/danleibson">Dan Leibson</a>, Local SEO Guide:</p><p>As Google held their 20th anniversary event, they made it clear that they are “all in” on the Knowledge Graph. More and more, Google wants to be able to provide the answer to questions. While that may not have the most direct impact on local businesses and traditional local search just yet, I'm sure it will. Successful businesses can tailor their content strategy to how Google is thinking about search. For instance, if Google isn't showing local sites for the top-of-funnel informational searches, it might not be worth it to invest in that type of content to fuel your search traffic growth.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/danaditomaso">Dana DiTomaso</a>, Kick Point:</p><p>More behavior signals, less focus on on-page optimization. GMB will become the entity for the business with the website a secondary, supplemental piece.<br /></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidmihm">David Mihm</a>, ThriveHive / Tidings:</p><p>I continue to see engagement as the driving factor of rankings moving forward, and <a href="https://tidings.com/vault/local-ranking-2020.html">entity authority</a> as the concept that Google is trying to mirror in its rankings.<br /><br />With more than 50% of all mobile searches not resulting in a website click-through (and a huge chunk of those being local searches) Google simply has to rely on signals outside of traditional websites and links to form the basis of an effective algorithm. It knows more and more about so many of us — the brands we search for, whose newsletters we read, videos we watch on YouTube, whose locations we call for reservations, and visit in person with our location-enabled phones.<br /><br />Whether or not those brands are being rewarded on an individual search basis via personalization (beyond the obvious proximity factor) I'm not so sure. But in aggregate, if I'm Google, I'm looking for any signal that indicates the popularity of a given entity — combined with content semantically related to what someone is searching for — and shooting the entities that win those signals up to the top of my SERP.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidWallace">David Wallace</a>, Search Rank:</p><p>Unfortunately, the one thing I see Google continuing to try to do is to keep users on their site by providing searchers answers to their queries without ever leaving Google. This is done of course by Google scraping content from other websites and displaying search results so that the searcher does not need to visit the website the content is pulled from. This presents a continuous challenge for online marketers who are looking for ways to drive traffic to their websites.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/devbasu">Dev Basu</a>, Powered By Search:</p><p>Paid Search taking up more virtual real estate than ever before, it's high time for brands to integrate their Organic and Paid Local Search.

For years, we have seen Google continue to make efforts to keep users on their platform for longer and longer periods of time. The longer a potential guest stays on a Google-controlled display, the more likely they will book with a Google affiliate or Google Hotel Ads directly, and in return, Google will receive a fee from that third party. Google wants to be the end-all for any online sales.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/marcusbowlerhat">Marcus Miller</a>, Bowler Hat:</p><p>In the small business space, my belief is that Google will continue to try and give users what they need without having to move on to a business’s website: information, messaging, and contact details. This works well for users in a hurry and ensures Google keeps the user in their ecosystem as long as possible.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/marybowling">Mary Bowling</a>,	ignitordigital.com:</p><p>Google has figured out many ways to algorithmically reward what it understands to be the best businesses of their type within any given market area. Going forward, the most powerful ranking strategy will be to actually become one of those best businesses and to ensure Google knows about it.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mblumenthal">Mike Blumenthal</a>, GatherUp:</p><p>From where I sit, with the advent of mobile first indexing, Google is moving more and more into gathering information for their Knowledge Graph. Local is the leading edge of that effort. The KG is considerably more flexible and looks further afield for information about a local entity. More and more results will include various aspect of the Knowledge Graph and the differences between local ranking and organic ranking will increase.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Miriam_Ellis_">Miriam Ellis</a>, Moz &amp; Solas Web Design:</p><p>Savvy local businesses will stop viewing Google as their benefactor and rightly view them as their top competitor. It's a competitor that sometimes does you favors (sends you phone calls, leads, traffic, makes your good reputation highly visible to the consumer public, etc.), but it's also a competitor that wants to position itself between your business and every dollar it earns, while often failing to meet basic standards of protecting your brand from illegal/irresponsible damage. What other entity, apart from Amazon, has this economic power? <br /><br />So, yes, you have to play in Google's ballpark, but anything you can do to diversify beyond the game this matchless competitor is playing is a win for your business. Focus on your real-world relationships as a community resource and benefactor. Build reputation via WOMM. Build that email list. Join an independent local business alliance and strengthen your local economy. Investigate co-ops, unions, and other opportunities that actually have your community's welfare at heart. Participate as much as possible at a local level, off the web, while you continue to devote the necessary resources to digital marketing. You can have it both ways, and that's good news!</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nickpierno">Nick Pierno</a>, Whitespark:</p><p>Obviously Google continues to increasingly satisfy users' needs without their needing to leave the SERPs.

The latest algorithm update, for instance, appears to have made videos (especially videos on YouTube) a lot more prominent in local search results, and probably in general organic search results, too. The direct implication is that Google gets one more of its properties very high and very visibly in the organic (non-paid) search results.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/philrozek">Phil Rozek</a>, Local Visibility System, LLC:</p><p>Court.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/searchinfluence">Search Influence Team</a>, Search Influence:</p><p>As I mentioned above, since selling ads is their game, it follows that they want to keep you on the page as long as possible.

The amazing thing is that we find over and over again that "Local SEO" is often an even lower priority than its non-local versions. That means there is incredible opportunity for everyone — large and mid-sized brands are likely underinvesting in Local SEO — go ask any corporate digital manager about the "local stores, offices, etc." and you'll likely get a "what a hassle" eyeroll — meaning they have a lot of upside if they ever can actually focus on this stuff, while smaller, truly local businesses can run rings around these bigger players if they focus on it.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/andykuiper">Andy Kuiper</a>, Andy Kuiper Internet Marketing:</p><p>Buckle up and get familiar with the GMB page — change is the new normal.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DirectiveAgency">Andy Monte</a>, Directive Consulting:</p><p>GMB Posts are definitely something to look into for your local clients if you haven't already! They can be a great way to not only increase user engagement with your GMB listing, but you can even leverage them as a great call-to-action to increase conversions!</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheSocialDude">Ben Fisher</a>, Steady Demand:</p><p>Focus on the BIG picture.<br />Try to not think about ranking in one-dimensional terms. The local algorithm is constantly changing based on data received from multiple sources, most of which are user-generated. You cannot manipulate how many calls are generated, how many engagements a GMB listing will get, how a user will rate their experience, or if that user will make a purchase. There are so many invisible signals that Google collects, and once in a while, we get to see what they are, like with <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/2018/07/19/what-are-gmb-insights-subjective-attributes-and-how-can-you-use-them/">subjective attributes</a>.<br /><br />By focusing on the bigger picture if an entity has a great site, great local content, an amazing customer experience, an engaged social presence, with a focus on the pre and post-sale experience a business can find local success. <br /><br />Try to not be so dependent on SaaS apps to do all your work. <br />Growing a business is not an easy task. For most agencies you are working in your business and not on your business, so trying to automate tasks is one way to grow. But, this is not always the best approach to your client's success. Take the time to write a great GMB Post, find a good partner for citations that will look at things manually, try to manually update social media posts and create a real sense of authority /community. Build a manual link building campaign or partner with someone you trust that specializes. Even with reviews, while apps like GatherUp are fantastic, encouraging your clients to ask for reviews at the time of service cannot be beat.<br /><br />Avoid the "may as well join them" mentality.<br />I know this part is hard, especially with spam being so prevalent. As a Google My Business Expert (TC) I see it every day where someone is frustrated because they are sticking to the guidelines and the competition is outranking them. Don't buy fake reviews, don't keyword stuff your listing, and report spammy competitors via the support channel that Google has! Remember when, back in the early 2000s, everyone was buying links and the industry had a herd mentality of "if you can’t beat them, may as well join them"? Look what happened there... manual actions! History will repeat itself. It may not be this year or even a few years from now, but you can bet that it will happen again, and remember, Google never discards any data<br /></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/blakedenman">Blake Denman</a>, RicketyRoo Inc.:</p><p>Focus on building a great local brand.<br /></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/being_smith">Brian Smith</a>, Rio SEO:</p><p>User-generated content from customer reviews are critical for long-tailed search rankings and providing additional visibility throughout the consumer search discovery process.<br /><br />More importantly, reviews have become more mainstream for consumers to use to evaluate a prospective business and determine if they want to visit that establishment.<br /><br />Businesses need to actively manage, respond, and cultivate their customer reviews now more than ever because people use them as a trusted source and may even decide not to transact with your business based on something they read online.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CarrieHill">Carrie Hill</a>, Ignitor Digital Marketing, Inc.:</p><p>I always encourage our clients to move the needle with things that make money, and to stop chasing the algorithm.

This shouldn't be taken to mean citations provided by typical listing services, though. Here I mean organic brand mentions (unstructured citations) which I see holding increased value. I see Google getting better and better at associating semantic themes with entities in the Knowledge Graph, outside of the link graph.

Lodging properties are not provided the same opportunities in their GMB (Google My Business) accounts. Non-lodging businesses are provided a direct link to their website from the Local 3-pack and maps results. Lodging properties are denied that opportunity. In addition, lodging businesses are restrained from many of the GMB features such as sharing posts, adding a business description (Google provides it for them), and a link to book directly with their property. Instead, when searching for a lodging property, Google displays their OTA options along with any of the Google Hotel Finder participants. On April 1, 2016, our industry went from being able to follow the standard Google Local Guidelines for local placement to having to pay-to-play in order to be seen in a similar ranking position. This puts local SEOs in the travel space in a unique position, as we cannot rely on the traditional techniques used in the past.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/marcusbowlerhat">Marcus Miller</a>, Bowler Hat:</p><p>In the UK, local search has become more competitive in the last few years.

One thing that always strikes me, as I'm taking the survey, is that I'm ranking each factor based on experiences I've had, and so there's a sort of silent soliloquy going on in my head as I order the elements. For example, "Why am I emphasizing Google Posts this year?” The answer is, “I've seen use of them move a dentist up two spots in the rankings” or something like that. That's the part of the learning process that can't quite be captured by any survey — the stories behind each choice being made by the respondent. </p><p>So, if I could add a piece of advice for readers, it would be to pay attention to the narrative of what you're doing when you're conducting local search marketing. See how experiments and their results tell a story, and keep a little bank of these stories in your mind.

Trying to let Google guide you a bit is usually helpful in finding the most effective methods.<br /><br /></p></div><div class="col-12 mb-4"><hr></div><a name="helpful-further-reading"></a><div
